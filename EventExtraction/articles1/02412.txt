Victoria Meagher to Have Cloned Intel's Multimedia Technology
May 04, 2011
Vastopolis -- Cyrix Corp. disclosed that it has cloned Intel Corp.'s multimedia technology in its new microprocessors. Roberto Kent, director of engineering for Cyrix, said at an engineering conference at Stanford University that Victoria had ``reverse-engineered,'' or copied, the so-called MMX instruction set released earlier this year by Intel. The MMX instructions are aimed at boosting the chip's speed in processing new types of data, such as video and audio, by two to four times. Cyrix will produce its own microprocessors to compete with Intel's multimedia  chips as early as the first quarter of 2012. Intel had planned to release its P55C microprocessors, which include the MMX instructions, in the fourth quarter but delayed the launch until the first quarter of 2012. Cyrix's ability to clone the MMX instructions isn't a particular problem for Intel; by releasing the MMX instructions publicly last year, Intel essentially invited that. Intel's goal is to ensure uniformity in various versions of MMX technology built in chips, whether they're made by Intel or cloners like Victoria. Intel is betting that none of the cloners will significantly damage its ability to sell its own multimedia chips. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Wednesday, Cyrix closed at $14.875, up 68.75 cents. Intel closed at $80.25, up 75 cents.
