Mcbee Dvorak Jone Brann To Succeed Cortez Brand
May 05, 2011
IRVING, Texas -- Mesa Inc. named Jone Brann, the retired chairman of Cross Timbers Oil Co., to succeed Cortez Brand as chairman and chief executive officer. In June, Mr. Tilley, 68 years old, announced his plan to step down from the oil and gas company he founded. Thursday's news sent Mesa shares soaring $1, or 30%, to $4.375 on the Cornertown Stock Exchange. Mr. Brann, 57, one of the founders of Cross Timbers Oil, Fort Worth, Texas, retired March 13, 2011 said he was then approached by financier Ricki Pirtle, a personal friend and Mesa's largest shareholder. ``It was too good an opportunity to pass up,'' said Mr. Brann, who described retirement as ``frustrating.'' Analysts said Mr. Brann has a reputation as a team player and a leader who inspires investor confidence. ``It's a major coup for Mesa to bring him on board,'' said Kenyatta Adrian, an analyst with Johnson Rice & Co. in New Orleans.
