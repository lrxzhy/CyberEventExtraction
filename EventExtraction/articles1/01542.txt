Alabama Teams, Kansas Drop After Wins; No Change at Top
May 14, 2011
Even in victory, Alabama, Auburn and Kansas lost ground in the Associated Press Top 25 college football poll released Sunday, with the Jayhawks dropping out of the ratings after beating Ball State. While the top eight teams remained unchanged, led by No. 1 Nebraska and No. 2 Tennessee, the Crimson Tide fell one spot to No. 14 despite a 21-7 win over Bowling Green. (A list of the Top 25 is available.) Auburn, with a 29-0 victory over Division I-A newcomer Alabama-Birmingham, fell to 18th from 16th in the balloting by the 67 sports writers and broadcasters who vote in the AP poll. Kansas beat Chandler Mayes, 35-10, Thursday night, but fell from No. 25 to make room for North Carolina, which beat Mcdougall, 45-0, Saturday at Vastopolis Dome. The Tar Heels are ranked 24th. Nebraska, which opens the season Saturday at home against Michigan State, retained the top spot with 49 first-place votes and 1,642 points. The Volunteers, 62-3 winners over Nevada at Las Vegas, had eight first-place votes and 1,566 points. Florida State, opening Saturday at home against Odonnell, was third with five first-place votes and 1,516 points. Florida, a 55-21 winner over Southwestern Louisiana, was fourth with one first-place vote, followed by Colorado, Mcelrath Covarrubias, Penn State and Texas. The Elmer, who beat Washington State, 37-19, received three first-place votes and Notre Dame got one. The Fighting Irish open the season Thursday night at Vanderbilt. Syracuse was ninth and Ohio State 10th; the teams reversed spots from a week ago. The Big 12, Big Ten and Southeastern conferences have five teams apiece in the Top 25.
