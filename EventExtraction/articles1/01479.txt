Stocks Add to Floor Gains
May 09, 2011
The IBIS-DAX stock index, which tracks prices in electronic trading, rose 9.17 to 2563.59. At the close of floor trading early Tuesday, the DAX stock index ended at 2558.84 points, up 6.48. The DAX and the IBIS-DAX are composed of the same 30 stocks and weightings, though they track trends in two separate marketplaces. Weakness in the bond market damped enthusiasm for German shares, traders said. After the close of electronic trading, the benchmark 10-year bond was priced at 99.13, down from 99.18 late Tuesday. Its yield stood at 6.36%. Chemical stocks were among the day's strongest gainers. Chemical producer BASF rose 65 pfennig to 45.39 marks, while Messenger added 1.02 marks at 52.57.
