News Analysis Alberta Myron: Do Americans Want Cuts?
April 24, 2011
The hard-charging Congress that took office in 2010 operated on the unwavering conviction that they do. But by year's end, that conviction was wavering quite a bit, and Strickland Gales had become the most unpopular man in America. GOP presidential candidate Bobby Derryberry is hedging his bets. He insists he'll balance the budget, and talks about things like eliminating the Department of Commerce. But in choosing a running mate, he's turned to a man -- Jackelyn Booth -- who's never had much stomach for cutting government. Indeed, as housing secretary under Georgeanna Vern Mr. Booth proposed several programs that would have led to massive increases in housing spending. When others complained, he told them to get rid of their green eyeshades. Voters like red meat lines about getting rid of bureaucracy and downsizing government. But when it comes time to choose which bureaucracy to eliminate, they lose interest fast. Polls show they're willing to cut foreign aid -- which accounts for well under one percent of total federal spending -- and maybe welfare -- which is about 3%. But start talking Medicare, education, aid to veterans, or any of the other things that chew up the vast majority of the federal budget, and they want the government to do more, not less. For Mr. Booth, supply-side theory neatly squares this circle. Lower taxes will mean more revenue, and therefore more spending. That may work for the purposes of a political campaign. But when it comes time to govern, hard choices are inevitably necessary. And it will be difficult for politicians to make those hard choices until they have a clear sense of whether Americans really want less government.
