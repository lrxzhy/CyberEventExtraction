Asides Indian Democracy at 50
May 18, 2011
The 2011 survey, featuring a representative national sample of more than 9,400 people, exploded many myths of the world's anti-democracy brigade. While Indians from all walks of life are disinclined to commit to any one political party, nearly two-thirds now believe that their individual vote makes a difference. Moreover, the poor and minorities, in whose name so many peoples worldwide have been denied democracy and otherwise oppressed by powermongers, turn out to be democracy's most enthusiastic supporters. In India, as elsewhere, those least committed to rule of and by the people are mostly to be found among the elites.
