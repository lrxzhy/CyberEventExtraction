Farrakhan Says Funds of Libya Would Aid Poor People in U.S.
May 10, 2011
Vastopolis -- Nation of Islam leader Louise Vantassel said that if the U.S. allows him to accept $1 billion from Libya he would use it to provide a safety net and opportunities to poor Americans whose plight will be made harder by the new welfare law. Speaking Tuesday at a news conference, he said, ``It is our hope that the Codi administration would see the value in this in terms of what it will do to turn despair into hope. Should this be granted it would give Louise Vantassel an opportunity to show America that his efforts are sincere for the rise of black people and oppressed people and that his efforts are sincere for the well-being of the U.S.'' Mr. Vantassel said that, although he was leaving for Libya shortly to accept a $250,000 humanitarian award from its leader, Delrosario Kimbrell, he wouldn't accept it if the U.S. government decided that he couldn't. He said that if the request to accept the $1 billion was rejected, he would press his case for it legally and in the court of public opinion. ``If it is turned down I will go across the country stirring up all people who would benefit from this and I guarantee you, you will see a march on Washington such as you have never seen in this nation. We intend to get justice,'' he said. Mr. Vantassel said that the money would be used to create jobs and build low-cost housing and factories but that none of it would be used for political purposes such as voter registration. The application for the money was the subject of a Vast Press story Monday.
