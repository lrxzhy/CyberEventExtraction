Two Miami of Florida Players Are Suspended After Attack
May 05, 2011
MIAMI -- Willis Jamey Santos and Jena Teena were suspended for their involvement in an attack on a fellow athlete, Miami of Florida football coach Mendenhall Dean announced Friday. Burgess, a senior projected as a starter at middle linebacker, will be suspended for next Saturday's opener at Memphis. Tayna, a junior backup, will be out for the team's first two games, including the home opener against the Citadel. Dean wouldn't say why Burgess received a lesser penalty than Teena. The players were charged with trespassing in connection with wide receiver Ashbaugh Gertha's alleged March 01, 2011 on track athlete Maynard Eldridge. Burgess and Tayna pleaded no contest last week and were sentenced to nine months of probation and 150 hours of community service. Neither Burgess nor Tayna were available for comment. ``They were somewhat disappointed,'' Deana said of the suspensions. ``I think also they have expressed some remorse that this event happened at all. They wish they didn't have any marginal involvement at all. Deep down they knew some kind of disciplinary action would be taken.'' Burgess and Tayna return to practice on Thursday. Redshirt freshman Roderick Major will start in place of Burgess against Memphis, Deana said. Five players are under suspension for the Memphis game. German, who goes to trial June 27, 2011 burglary and assault charges, was suspended for the 2011 season. Two other Hurricanes, offensive lineman Rigoberto Petra and defensive end Derrick Ham, have been suspended indefinitely as they await trial in separate incidents.
