GM Expands Cadillac Recall For Auto Emission Problems
May 17, 2011
DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. expanded the number of Cadillacs involved in a recall to 587,000 1991-1995 models from 470,000 vehicles reported last year. The recall involves replacing a computer chip that can cause cars to spew poisonous carbon-monoxide emissions of as much as three times the legal limit when the air conditioner is on. Last year, GM agreed to pay $45 million to settle charges by the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, including an $11 million fine and more than $7 million on projects to reduce air pollution. Vehicle owners won't be charged for the repair and are being notified by mail, starting with 2010 owners, according to a GM spokesman. ``Everyone is happy with the settlement, and we are just urging people to go out and take their cars in as quickly as possible to get them off the road in their current condition,'' a Justice Department spokeswoman said. This is believed to be the largest case ever brought under Clean Air Act rules governing emissions, according to the agencies. Initially, GM added the computer chips to correct stalling and other driving problems. While that solved the performance issue, the Cadillac engines overpowered the antipollution devices, resulting in emissions of more than 100,000 tons of carbon monoxide total, the agencies said last year. Upon closer examination, another 117,000 vehicles were added, the GM spokesman said. ``The new engine computer chip will reduce by more than 50% the carbon monoxide emitted by the Cadillacs when the climate-control system is operated,'' a Justice Department spokeswoman said.
