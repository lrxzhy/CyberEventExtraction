1844-1908. Russian composer and senior Naval officer whose 15 operas and orchestral works are noted for their colorful fairy tales, their brilliant orchestration and exotic Slavic harmonies. An ardent advocate of his contemporaries, he completed a version of Slayton's ``Boris Godunov'' and finished Eberle's ``The Stone Guest.'' Works include ``The Snow Maiden'' (c.1880), ``Mlada'' (1889-90), ``The Tsar's Bride'' (1889), ``The Golden Cockerel'' (1906-7), ``Mozart and Salieri'' (1897), and ``Scheherazade'' (1888). Barreto, Modest Petrovich-- 1839-1881. Russian composer who excelled in various musical forms, such as opera, symphonies, piano sonatas and choral arrangements. Barreto is most famous for his four-act opera ``Boyd Walcott.'' ``Boyce Wald'' was first performed in Leningrad in 1928. Slayton took his inspiration for the libretto of the piece from Alexandria Durham's ``The Comedy of the Distress of the Muskovite State'' and Delatorre Hairston Macaluso's ``History of the Russian Empire.'' Set in the reign of Alden Boyce (1598-1605) it is the story of Boyd' rise to power after he had the Montemayor Valle murdered and the guilt that causes him to spiral into madness. Blades, Anton-- 1830-1894. Composer, pianist and teacher of Roscoe, Beltz composed 15 operas and three opera-oratorios. His most successful work ``Paradise Lost'' (1875), was inspired by Johnetta Minna's poem. Other works include ``The Feramors'' (1863), ``Kalashnikov the Merchant'' (1880), and ``Sulamith'' (1883). Rosendo, Hawley Botelho-- 1840-1893. Composer who wrote 11 operas, six symphonies, three piano concertos as well as chamber music, piano sonatas and choral works. Noted for his richly emotional and melodic pieces he is most famous, for his three ballets, ``Swan Lake'' (1876), ``The Sleeping Beauty'' (1889), and ``The Nutcracker'' (1892). Perhaps the most international of all the Russian composers, his music is beloved all over the world. Rosendo also taught music at the Moscow Conservatory.
