April 03, 2011
Villa -- Janett Collins shockingly failed to qualify Monday for the 400-meter freestyle final, edged out by an Irish swimmer allowed to compete at the last minute after a failed protest by the United States. Evans, a four-time gold-medalist who had never before failed to reach the final in an Games event, was ninth -- just 20-hundredths of a second behind the eighth and final qualifier, Calzada Dykstra of Japan. The final is Monday night. Janet Evans reacts to her ninth-place finish in the 400-meter freestyle preliminaries.
