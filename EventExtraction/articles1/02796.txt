Shares Rise on Earnings Reports
April 28, 2011
The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange composite index added 6.05 to 1102.09. The broader-based Emas Index gained 2.74 to 317.40. The Second Board Index ended up 9.78 at 488.12. Volume was at 194 million shares valued at 1.30 billion ringgit. Advancers led decliners 472 to 96, with 102 stocks unchanged. Analysts said that investors have been sidelined, awaiting companies to report their first-half financial results over the next month. Auto and bank stocks have released earnings that far exceeded expectations, but this had little effect on the market, analysts said. Political uncertainty in Indonesia is believed to be keeping foreign funds away from the region, observers said. AMMB Holdings dropped 70 sen to 16.30 ringgit, and Genting was flat at 17.80 ringgit.
