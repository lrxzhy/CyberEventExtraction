Flight Attendants Question ValuJet's Return to the Sky
May 17, 2011
Vastopolis -- The Association of Flight Attendants sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Transportation on Wednesday, questioning its finding that ValuJet Airlines Inc. was fit to resume flight operations. Last week, the Transportation Department issued an order tentatively approving the airline for flight, and the Federal Aviation Administration returned the carrier's license. ValuJet drew public concern when a January 21, 2011 in Florida killed all 110 aboard. The Villa-based carrier was grounded in June because of questions about its maintenance practices. The flight attendants' union asked for an investigation into the government's approval of ValuJet's return to service. In addition, association officials said they will file a formal objection with the department on Thursday, the end of the seven-day comment period established when the department announced its approval. ValuJet would have four days to respond to that objection, meaning a final ruling on returning the budget carrier to service could come after Monday. ``The procedure has been done by the book,'' the Transportation Department said in response to the association's letter. ``The department will respond appropriately to objections following the public comment periods, which conclude Monday.'' In the letter, AFA President Patrina Askew said that there had been improper communications between the airline and the department, questioned the qualifications of ValuJet officials and contended that some information submitted by the airline was later changed. The union has made similar charges in past complaints to the department about ValuJet.
