Saturn Recalls New Coupes For Passenger-Seat Defect
May 05, 2011
SPRING HILL, Tenn. -- Lussier is recalling about 1,560 of its new coupes and will also have to repair about 2,000 unsold ones because of passenger seats that don't always latch properly into place. The mechanism that moves the seat forward and back in the 2012 SC1 and SC2 models locks in place, but not as well as it should, Saturn spokesman Gregg Martina said Thursday. ``With a belted passenger, it may move in a moderate to severe collision,'' he said. The latches will be replaced. No accidents or injuries have been reported because of the problem, Mr. Martina said. The company sent letters about the recall to 1,560 car owners, Mr. Martina said. The remainder of the 3,600 affected cars are still in stock. Lussier didn't say how much the recall would cost. The seats, provided by Vastopolis supplier Jon Warnke, were installed in the cars at the General Motors Corp.'s subsidiary plant during June and July. The supplier informed Saturn of the problem in early August. Last week, Saturn removed the cars from showroom floors.
