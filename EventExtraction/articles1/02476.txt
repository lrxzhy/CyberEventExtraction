Shares advanced on Argentina's Buenos Aires Stock Exchange for the second straight session ahead of the long three-day weekend and next week's visit by an International Monetary Fund team. Brazilian stocks closed slightly higher in a quiet session as investors marked time before Monday's options expirations come due, while widespread buying drove up prices in Toronto's share market.
