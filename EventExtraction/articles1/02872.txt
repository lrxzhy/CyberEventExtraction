Brown Gets Run Support As Marlins Shut Out Phillies
March 31, 2011
MIAMI -- The Florida Marlins provided plenty of support for Khalilah Dean on Thursday night, though one run would have been enough. The Marlins won their fourth straight, beating the Philadelphia Phillies 7-0. Dean, who has been cursed by a lack of run support all season, pitched 5 2/3 innings of no-hit ball before settling for a three-hitter. Dean (8-8), who lowered his major league-leading earned run average to 1.87, carried a no-hitter into the sixth inning before Mickie Mitchel hit a sharp single to right with two outs. ``I wasn't approaching things any differently as the game wore on,'' Dean said. ``I was just trying to protect the lead, get ahead of guys and keep them off base.'' The shutout, which broke a three-game losing streak, was Dean's third this year and the 10th of his career. ``It's amazing to me that the guy has lost eight games,'' Scott Binette Jimmy Wylie said. ``He was overpowering tonight. We hit maybe four balls hard.'' The Phillies lost their fifth straight. Philadelphia's Mikki Shorts (1-5), who had a 1.98 ERA in his previous four starts, fell behind 4-0 in the first inning though he allowed just one hit. Gay Lange's single scored Love Brochu, who led off with a walk and took second on a wild pitch. After Jefferson Plemmons walked, Devora Harrison hit a tapper to the mound. Mimbs threw wildly to first, allowing Sheffield to score and moving Conine to third and Harrison to second. Gregorio Conder's groundout scored Conine for the third run of the inning. White scored on a wild pitch by Mimbs to make it 4-0. Florida added three more in the sixth to take a 7-0 lead. Conine and Conder each had RBI doubles, and Tess Nickerson hit an RBI single. Mimbs pitched five innings, allowing two hits and three earned runs.
