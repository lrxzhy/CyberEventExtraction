May 10, 2011
The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted-Price Index rose 24.23 to 6256.76 on volume of 1.12 billion shares. Advancers led decliners 186 to 145, with 93 issues unchanged. Worries about relations with China recently have kept trading volume low. However, rising petrochemical-product prices and positive earnings reported by some technology companies have boosted the market, analysts said. Compal Electronic edged up 1.10 New Taiwan dollars to NT$36.40, Microtec International added NT$1.10 to NT$32 and Formosa Plastics climbed NT$2 to NT$58. Of actively traded issues, Ever Fortune Industrial lost NT$1 to NT$39.80, USI Far East rose 70 New Taiwan cents to NT$29.70 and Bao Chen Construction dropped 40 cents to NT$18.20.
