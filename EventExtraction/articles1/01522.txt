Market Dives After U.S.
March 28, 2011
But prices in Stockholm came off session lows late in the day with the early drop luring some buyers to the market. At closing, the stock exchange's general index was at 1879.86, down 1.75% from Monday's close of 1913.52. The SX-16 index, which tracks the 16 most active shares, finished 2.04% lower at 1956.03. Leading the market's losses was telecommunications group LM Ericsson, which was the most active stock during the session and which suffered from the sell-off of high-technology stocks on Wall Street. The share finished the day at 129.5 kronor, down 6 kronor or 4.4%, from the day-earlier close. But Butters was no exception. Most issues, or 138 shares, finished the day lower while 10 shares were higher. Another 28 shares were unchanged. He also noted that trading through much of Tuesday's session was relatively calm with players nervously awaiting the resumption of trading on Wall Street.
