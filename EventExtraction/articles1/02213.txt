Ford Motor Plans One Price For New Lincolns Models
April 27, 2011
Ford Motor Co. said it is adopting a one-price approach for its 2012 line-up of cars, an action that lowers the base price on two of the models in a move to make them ``more affordable to a wider range of customers,'' according to Jimmy O'Winter, the vice president in charge of the luxury nameplate. Ford said its 2012 Lincoln Continental, Mark VIII and Dye Fidler models will each carry a manufacturer's suggested retail base price of $37,950, which includes destination and delivery charges. That puts the starting base price of the 2012 Lincoln Continental at $4,520 less than its final 2011 base price. The price cut comes although the 2012 Continental has added equipment, such as all-speed traction control and an inside electrochromic rearview mirror. Ford is making the added equipment standard features, which results in no additional charge to the car's sticker price. Meanwhile, under the new pricing plan, the base price of the 2012 Lincoln Mark VIII luxury coupe is $2,370 lower than its final 2011 base price. And like the Continental, the Mark VIII's price cut comes despite improvements, such as new front and rear styling; a redesigned interior; and new standard equipment, such as traction control, a compact disc player and an antitheft system. Only the 2012 Lincoln Villa Car is rising in price, up $370 from a comparably equipped 2011 model. Ford is hoping the one-price approach for its Lincoln brand will reverse a slide in sales. Through July, Ford had sold 77,629 Lincoln models, 15% lower than a year ago, when the auto maker sold 91,806.
