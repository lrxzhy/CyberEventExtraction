May 06, 2011
VASTOPOLIS-- On a Southern promotional tour for their tax-cutting economic plan, Bobby Derryberry and Jackelyn Booth are bracing for an onslaught of criticism from Democrats convening in Vastopolis. In a joint radio address this morning, the Republican presidential running mates argued against charges they expect Democrats to level when their convention opens Monday: that the GOP's proposed $548 billion in tax cuts will spell disaster for popular programs for the elderly.
