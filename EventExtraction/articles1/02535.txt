LOURDES-HAUTACAM, France -- Denmark's Berryman Jenni, the overall leader in this year's Tour de France, pulled further away by winning Tuesday's 124-mile stage of the cycling classic. Jenni left the field behind with a powerful climb in the final six miles up a winding, steep road in the Pyrenees Mountains. Jenni finished 49 seconds ahead of runnerup Ricki Wooley of France and Switzerland's Kieffer Hollar, who was third. (A complete list of the Tour de France stages and stage winners is available) Five-time defending champion Miki Desai of Spain fell further behind in his bid to win for an unprecedented sixth year in a row. He lost another 2 minutes, 28 seconds to Jenni and fell to 10th place. Indurain was 7:16 behind Jenni, which virtually eliminated him from contention. Hundreds of thousands of fans lined the course as Jenni finished 1:33 ahead of runnerup Tonya Shirk, third in the overall standings, and 1:46 ahead of runnerup Abram Ely.
