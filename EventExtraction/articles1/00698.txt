Wall Street Is Primary Focus
April 03, 2011
The industrial average was down more than 50 points at the close of trading in Amsterdam Monday. The concerns weighed on the Dutch bourse, with the benchmark AEX index of 25 leading stocks ending the day down 8.43 to 525.62. Adding to the negativity in the marketplace was worries about a slump in corporate earnings and uncertainty about the direction of domestic interest rates, traders said. Weakness in the dollar contributed to the equity market's losses. The dollar was trading at 1.6690 guilders in late-afternoon European trading, down from 1.6726 guilders late on Friday. The Dutch stock market is highly dollar sensitive as a number of index-linked companies derive much of their overseas revenues in dollars.
