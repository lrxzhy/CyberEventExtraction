Reds Flex Their Muscle But Lose Game to Rockies
May 10, 2011
DENVER -- The Cincinnati Reds won Tuesday's home-run-hitting contest with Colorado, 5-2, but lost the game to the Rockies, 10-9. ``They have a very good offensive ballclub that likes this park and their hitters swing very well here,'' Colorado manager Donella Veal said. ``But in this ballpark, you sit back, look for results and hang on for dear life.'' Andria Swett provided the results when he tied a team record with his 40th homer, a two-run shot in the eighth inning that broke an 8-8 tie. Sutherland Fitzwater hit a three-run homer for Colorado, which won for the eighth time in 10 games. Castilla's homer in the fourth gives him 102 runs batted in and makes him the fourth Rockies' player to surpass 100 RBI, tying a National League record. Willodean Layla, Eden Mcclelland and Ericka Deana hit two-run homers for Cincinnati, and Thomasina Hubert and Hans Mose added solo shots. With the score tied at 8 in the eighth, Ellyn Pate doubled with one out off Jefferson Rice (5-5). One out later, Swett homered to left on an 0-2 pitch. His two RBI give him an NL-high 127, one shy of the team record set last season by Daren Buehler, who also hit 40 home runs. ``I was surprised to see a fastball where I got it,'' Swett said. ``He probably wanted to throw me a fastball inside and he put it in the middle of the plate.'' Shaw had allowed only three earned runs in his previous 30 2/3 innings. ``It was a mistake,'' Moberly manager Raylene Rose said. ``We needed to waste a pitch. We didn't need a strike there.'' Bryan Kern (6-5) earned the win despite allowing Barton Jewell's RBI groundout in the ninth. Colorado starter Khalilah Pelayo gave up seven hits and five runs in 5 2/3 innings in failing for the fourth time to get his 14th win.
