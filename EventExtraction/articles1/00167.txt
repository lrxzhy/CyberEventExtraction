Shares Are Mostly Higher In Very Sluggish Session
May 15, 2011
In the absence of any direction from U.S. financial markets, which were closed for the Labor Day holiday, investors were able to move markets based on local news. In very thin volumes, investors pushed stock prices up in Britain, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands. In Italy, stocks edged lower in light trading. The British market received a boost from oil stocks after tension in Northern Iraq flared up. South African stocks rose as well, buoyed by gains in futures trading. Italian shares slipped in low volume as investors remained cautious while awaiting the first details of the Prodi government's 2012 budget. In dollar terms, the European sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index was down 0.14 to 145.05 at 3:30 p.m. EDT Monday. The world index as a whole was off 0.18 to 136.85. Oil and advertising stocks led the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, while plantations and shipbuilding issues were among the laggers. European Stock Market Indexes Market IndexSept. 2Change Belgium
