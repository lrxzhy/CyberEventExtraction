Stocks Stall in Quiet Trading
April 04, 2011
The Bel-20 Index of leading shares edged up 1.03 to 1673.53 on volume of 1.4 billion Belgian francs worth of shares. Stocks moved higher in early trading, buoyed by gains in the U.S. equity market, but the Belgian market quickly gave back those gains to trade at or near Monday's closing level for much of the day. Among actively traded shares, oil group Petrofina rose 40 Belgian francs to 9,440. Traders said Petrofina stock was boosted by higher half-year results coming from U.S. oil companies.
