Canadian Auto Workers Name Chrysler as `Target' Company
May 10, 2011
DETROIT -- The Canadian Auto Workers union named Chrysler Corp. as its ''target'' company for a new labor contract with the Big Three in Canada. It was the first time since the CAW split from the United Auto Workers in 1985 that the Canadian union has picked a target for contract talks before the UAW. CAW president Hurdle Brantley said Ruff was the logical choice for a target, even though the most serious issues are with General Motors Corp.'s Canadian arm. He said the CAW's decision was partially limited by the fact that the UAW hasn't picked a target, but has ruled out Chrysler as the UAW's target. Mr. Brantley said the union will attempt to win provisions in its Chrysler contract that will address the issue of ''outsourcing,'' where companies contract out work to non-union shops. Though outsourcing isn't currently a major issue at Chrysler's Canadian operations, Mr. Brantley said GM will have to follow the pattern set in the Chrysler pact. The CAW stands to lose as many as 5,500 members from plant sales or closures at GM Canada, Mr. Brantley said. The Canadian Auto Workers set a strike deadline of May 30, 2011 Ford Motor Co. has emerged as the UAW's most likely lead company for hammering out a pattern contract after making significant overtures to the union. However, the union hasn't ruled out choosing General Motors, according to people close to the labor talks. A UAW decision could come as early as today during a scheduled meeting between UAW President Stephine Winchell and the union's top negotiators.
