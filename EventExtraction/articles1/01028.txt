Americas Stocks End Lower; Street's Losses Hurt Mexico
May 18, 2011
Mexican share prices fell on Wall Street's weakness, despite the release of positive economic data that showed Mexico's June industrial production grew 12% over the year-ago month. Canadian stocks declined amid widespread selling, before Friday's release of U.S. jobs data for August. In Argentina, share prices posted gains, but volume was light as investors awaited the release of U.S. jobs data for August, and its effect on short-term interest rates. Brazilian stocks fell on low volume and a lack of market-moving news. In dollar terms, the Americas sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index dropped 1.43 to 152.31 Thursday, after adding 0.26 the previous day.
