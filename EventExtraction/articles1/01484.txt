U.S.-Japan Aviation Talks Proceed Without Agreement
April 27, 2011
TOKYO -- Japan and the U.S. ended the first of two days of working-level aviation talks Thursday without reaching any agreements on how to defuse an escalating aviation dispute. A spokesman for Japan's Ministry of Transport said no agreements had been made, but the talks would continue on Friday. He declined to comment on whether the discussions went smoothly, except to say that the U.S. presented its case Thursday and that Japan will present its position Friday. Both sides have threatened to impose sanctions on the other's air cargo carriers following Tokyo's refusal to grant Federal Express additional routes beyond Japan to other Asian destinations. Similar sanctions have also been threatened on two passenger routes. Japan maintains the current aviation agreement between the two countries grants too much leeway to U.S. carriers to exercise such ``beyond rights'' past Japan, and is seeking a complete review of the agreement.
