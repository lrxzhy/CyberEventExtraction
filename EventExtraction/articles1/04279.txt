April 04, 2011
The All Ordinaries index of share prices fell 16.4 to 2136.0, following the overnight losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Volume was 187.1 million shares valued at 421.8 million Australian dollars. Analysts said the market lost most of its ground in early trading, and then drifted lower as buying support continued to evaporate. Nearly all market sectors ended down, with the media sector again performing worse than most due to a decline in Russel Mccary's News Corp.. News Corp. fell 17 Australian cents to A$6.26, its lowest closing level since April 2010. Brokers blamed the fall on the company's US$2.48-billion takeover bid for New World Communications Group. News Corp.'s preferred limited-voting ordinary shares lost 11 cents Tuesday to A$5.06. Decliners outnumbered gainers 392 to 218. Among blue-chip stocks, Broken Hill Proprietary slipped 17 cents to A$16.58, Lend Lease fell 15 cents to A$19 and Coca-Cola Amatil lost 22 cents to A$14.26.
