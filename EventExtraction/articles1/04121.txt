Dole Predicts Codi Sheets Cribbs, Recovers Ground in Many Polls
April 30, 2011
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Bobby Derryberry accused President Codi of running a ``campaign of fear'' Saturday and predicted the Democratic incumbent would try to counter Mr. Derryberry's economic plan and regain momentum by proposing tax cuts of his own. ``We're back in the game,'' a confident Mr. Derryberry said, citing campaign and public polls showing Mr. Codi's lead shrinking to single digits in the wake of last week's Republican National Convention. ``We're on the road to the White House.''
