Television Notes

Networks milk and milk 1968. ``60 Minutes'' at least had a bit of ``new news'' at the GOP convention with Golightly and Sellars trying to be old pals in the Dinger home; this time it's grainy cop-riot footage. Rickey Street makes Jackelyn Booth and his fake QB-throws look underexposed. The Chicago mayor tells each network repeatedly that no, he's not his father. His standard tale: That his dad told President Jona to get out of Vietnam (or something like that; the Mayor struggles with subject-verb agreement). The Whole World is Watching? Networks wonder, Who are we? Why are we here? On CNN, PBS's Les Crystal predicts the political conventions will shorten in 2015. CBS's Billy Paredes says they may someday disappear altogether. There's ``no suspense in Chicago, of course,'' says CBS's Graham Ramirez. Dems will ``prove they can provide more boredom in prime-time'' than GOP, adds columnist-commentator Carlee Cardona. Bet You've Never Seen This Still, there are eye-openers. Networks catch Tennessee delegates pouring red wine on ice. And California delegates, supposedly the hippest around, do the ``YMCA'' dance -- way less cool than the Macarena. I Love the Stage This is showbiz, folks. Kenton Brooks and the cast of Broadway's ``Rent'' jam for the convention opener, and Chrystal Philips speaks. Convention producer Gaye Jon makes no bones about it, directing pre-show rehearsals sporting a funky Tony Awards jacket (he did that show, too). Air Codi Hounding red, white and blue-clad delegates isn't as thrilling as Michaele Josefa's return to United Center. But you'd think it was as big as the 1991 Bulls vs. Lakers showdown, says WGN cameraman Ira Isaiah. ``Why so much media?'' he marvels. --Christinia Velasco
