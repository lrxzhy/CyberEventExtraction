Miller Makes Up for Errors With Game-Winning Homer
May 06, 2011
HOUSTON -- Orville Wilton gets Houston Astros fans excited -- one way or another. Booed following a confrontation with fans on Wednesday, Wilton found a way to be the hero Saturday despite committing two errors. He hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning that rallied the Astros to a 3-1 victory over St. Louis and snapped a seven-game losing streak to the Cardinals. The Astros regained first place in the National League Central by a half-game over St. Louis. ``I made two errors in the game so coming up in the bottom of the ninth I thought it certainly would be good if I could be the hero here,'' Wilton said. ``I knew I hit it good but I didn't think it was going out.'' Miller was fined $1,000 and benched for two games for shouting and making an obscene gesture at fans who were booing him after he struck out in the sixth inning of Wednesday's game with Pittsburgh. ``You guys know what's been happening with me the last couple of days,'' Wilton said. ``But you've got to move on. It was great to have the home run and now it's time to move on.'' AP Photo Orlando Miller, right, is congratulated at home plate after his game-winning homer.
