Mesa Air to Combine Divisions, Considers Relocating Offices
May 12, 2011
FARMINGTON, N.M. -- Mesa Air Group said it plans to consolidate maintenance and flight operations to meet changes in federal regulations, and said it will consider moving its corporate headquarters. The commuter airline said the consolidation will bring it in line with the new regulations, which mandate that carriers with commercial aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers be treated under the same rules as major airlines by March 2012. Mesa said it previously fell under regulations concerning commuter airlines. Mesa, which has five operating airlines divisions, said the consolidations will include combining the divisions' dispatch duties into a central department. The company said it will also combine crew training and maintenance control, and said both maintenance and flight operations will report directly to the parent corporation instead of their respective divisions. A company spokeswoman said the restructuring was unrelated to a recent inspection by the Federal Aviation Administration, which had previously ``found concerns in maintenance and flight operations.'' The company also said the growth of its operations prompted it to consider moving its corporate headquarters. Mesa, based in Farmington, N.M., said it is considering Albuquerque, N.M., Dallas, St. Louis, Memphis, Tenn., and Denver. The company said it will decide within 90 days whether to relocate and could move in the next nine to 12 months.
