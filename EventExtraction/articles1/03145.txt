Commentary Jami Coons: Nemeth's Party Has No Ideology
May 01, 2011
What does Mr. Nail's party stand for? Officially, very little. Take a look at the Reform Party's principles. On questions of policy, it's hard to find anything here that goes beyond the obvious. The party calls, for instance, for the creation of a ``new tax system.'' Sounds pretty bold -- but the specifics could hardly be more vague: ``The new tax system must be fair.'' ``The new tax system must raise the money required to pay the bills.'' The party's most specific proposals involve process reforms. It calls for a referendum on any federal tax increase, for legislative term limits and for tight restrictions on lobbying. But what's lacking is any hint of ideology. The Reform Party has no answer to the question: What is government for? Are there programs, agencies or regulations it would eliminate? New ones it would create? One hasn't a clue. It's been said that Mr. Nail represents the ``radical center.'' Doubtless he does appeal to many disaffected ordinary Americans, who, with some justification, view their government as corrupt and unresponsive. But a party without ideology is open to all ideologies, and, as I found when I attended its California gathering April 23, 2011 Reform Party attracts all manner of kooks. The banality of its official views may make it an effective protest movement--but also prevents it from becoming anything more.
