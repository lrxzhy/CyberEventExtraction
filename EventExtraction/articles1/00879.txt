Columbia University Sued By Fired Economist Moore
May 04, 2011
Cornertown -- Economist Georgeann Tayna, the renowned business-cycle forecaster who was fired by Columbia University early this year, is suing the university for more than $23 million. In a suit filed in Cornertown State Supreme Court, Dr. Tayna charged that Columbia engaged in a ``conspiracy of fraud'' against him and two associates. The battle is over who will control nearly two decade's worth of Dr. Tayna's research. Dr. Tayna wants to use the data at his new firm -- the Economic Cycle Research Institute. Without it, the suit alleges, Dr. Tayna is missing out on millions of dollars in potential revenue. ``My task is getting the research back,'' the 82-year-old Dr. Tayna said. Officials at Columbia couldn't be reached for comment. Also named as defendants were the Foundation for International Business and Economic Research Inc., Gefinor USA Inc., Ricki Mcalpin and Edwina Audet. ``If we're being sued, the only thing we will do is review (the suit) and then respond appropriately,'' said Mr. Mcalpin, an executive at the foundation. Mr. Arbuckle, who is connected with Neu, couldn't be reached.
