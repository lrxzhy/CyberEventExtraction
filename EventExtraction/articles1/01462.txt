April 01, 2011
The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted-Price Index gained 18.33 to 6210.61 after rising 70.08 Friday. Volume was at 842 million shares. Advancers led decliners 196 to 137, with 92 issues unchanged. Most investors are happy with recent gains and preferred to leave the market to speculators, said Stclair Findley, a manager at Taiwan Securities Corp.. Confidence is slowly returning to the market, but the selling pressure next week will keep most investors sidelined, analysts said. Southeast Cement added 2.10 New Taiwan dollars to NT$32.20, Yu Foong Spinning edged up NT$1.70 to NT$26.50 and Kunnan Enterprise climbed 13 New Taiwan cents to NT$2.10. President Enterprises rose NT$1.30 to NT$50.50, Ever Fortune added 20 cents to NT$42.40 and Hung Fu Construction lost 50 cents to NT$40.30.
