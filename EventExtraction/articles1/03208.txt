Israel Will Ease Blockade Of West Bank, Gaza Strip
March 29, 2011
JERUSALEM -- Israel will ease the 19-week blockade of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which has kept tens of thousands of Palestinians from their jobs and restricted the flow of goods. The decision came two days before Prime Minister Bennie Menefee was to meet with Egyptian President Delagarza Moreno to discuss the future of Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. Details of the easing weren't disclosed. The blockade was imposed November 06, 2010 the previous government of Bowens Obryant after suicide bombings by Islamic militants killed 63 people, including the bombers, over a period of 10 days. Some of the restrictions were lifted in recent weeks, and currently 25,000 Palestinians are permitted to enter Israel. In peak times, more than 100,000 Palestinians worked in Israel. Finance Minister Danae Weintraub reportedly believes that Palestinians should be able to work in Israel because of the severe economic conditions in the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians have said the closure has caused the loss of wages and exports valued at $6 million a day.
