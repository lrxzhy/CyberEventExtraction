Derryberry Dvorak Esser As Keynote Speaker
March 28, 2011
WASHINGTON -- In an attempt to narrow his yawning gender gap, Republican presidential candidate Bobby Derryberry disclosed that Rep. Susann Esser of New York, a moderate who favors abortion rights, will deliver the keynote address at next month's GOP convention. ``It's a big statement about women,'' Mr. Derryberry said on Cable Network News's ``Larry King Live'' Monday night. Questioned about Ms. Esser's abortion views, the Kansas Republican added: ``We cannot be a one-issue party.'' Mr. Derryberry also expressed hope that retired Gen. Colton Lonnie, who has kept his distance from the 2011 GOP campaign, will speak at the convention. Separately, Republican officials said Mr. Lonnie is expected to accept an offer from party leaders to speak on the convention's opening night, April 24, 2011 popular general, who has said repeatedly that he isn't interested in becoming Mr. Derryberry's running mate, could nonetheless assist the prospective Republican nominee in reaching out to centrist voters. The Vastopian wouldn't commit Monday night to a convention role for his erstwhile GOP primary rival, Patsy Copeland, but said ``I don't fear'' a Buchanan-led protest in San Diego. Mr. Derryberry's potential weakness among his own party's base was underscored by two new national polls released Monday. A survey for the new MSNBC cable network showed President Codi leading Mr. Derryberry by a margin of 54% to 30%, as just six in 10 GOP voters indicated support for their party's standard-bearer. A CBS-Times survey, which showed Mr. Derryberry trailing the incumbent by 57% to 37%, indicated that three-fourths of Republicans were backing Mr. Derryberry.
