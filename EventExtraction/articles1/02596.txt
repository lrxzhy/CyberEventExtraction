Market Loses Early Gains
March 29, 2011
The Philippines Stock Exchange index of 41 selected issues tumbled 11.66 to 3187.66. Philippine National Bank led the losers as it fell 25 pesos to 445 pesos after its president said that the bank's first-half earnings failed to meet its target. ``People are very edgy,'' noted Glennie Robinson, general manager for L.M. Garcia and Associates. ``They don't want to take on any fresh positions.'' Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to close with gains Tuesday, investors remain concerned about its volatile swings because of the lower-than-expected earnings performance of some U.S. companies.
