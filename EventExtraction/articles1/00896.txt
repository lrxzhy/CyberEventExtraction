Shares Close Barely Higher
May 06, 2011
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index inched up 0.71 to 782.13 after rising 1.75 Friday. Volume totaled a modest 13.76 million shares. Advancing issues outscored decliners 409 to 379, while 157 ended unchanged. Fourteen shares fell to their bottom limits while 102 issues rose to their permitted highs. Though smaller issues were strong, losses in other, large-capitalization stocks left the composite index minus most of its intraday gains. Samsung Electronics fell 2,100 won to 65,900 won on news reports that the nation's trade deficit may total $20 billion this year and the sluggish exports of semiconductor largely will be blamed for the widening trade deficit. Samsung is the nation's largest semiconductor maker.
