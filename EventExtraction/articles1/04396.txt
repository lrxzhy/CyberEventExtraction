Bargain-Hunting Lifts Market
March 29, 2011
The 2.5% jump in the Taiwan market was the largest in five weeks. It was led by a 4.1% increase in both petrochemical and financial blue chips and a 3.0% jump in steel shares. The main index surged 147.23 to 6102.73. Investors were encouraged by the late rally on U.S. stock markets and bought into blue chips such as Nan Ya Plastics, up 3 New Taiwan dollars to NT$52; Shinkong Life, up NT$5 to NT$102.50; and Cathay Life, up NT$8 to NT$178. Trading volume was down slightly at 1.3 billion shares valued at NT$45.1 billion from the previous session's 1.3 billion shares valued at NT$45.4 billion. Losers lagged winners 146 to 205, while the remaining 74 issues were unchanged.
