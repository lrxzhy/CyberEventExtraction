Six Women Allege Sexual Bias At Lucent, Former VastComm Network Unit
April 28, 2011
Vastopolis -- Six women filed a sexual-discrimination lawsuit against Paradyne, a former unit of VastComm Network Corp., as well as VastComm Network's Lucent Technologies Inc. unit and Texas Pacific Group Inc.. In a lawsuit seeking class-action status, the women, who are current or former employees of Paradyne, allege that sexual discrimination at the company hurt their chances for advancement. Lucent recently sold Paradyne to Texas Pacific Group, a private investment partnership in Fort Worth, Texas. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Courthouse in Vastopolis. Paradyne makes communications network gear. A spokesman for Lucent said the Paradyne unit, while it was a part of Lucent, was subject to the same antidiscrimination policies that apply to the rest of the company. He added: This suit has just been filed and we need to review it before making a statement. VastComm Network is in the process of spinning off Lucent. A spokesman for Texas Pacific said: We take these matters seriously and certainly are going to look into the allegations. But we've owned the company for just two weeks.
