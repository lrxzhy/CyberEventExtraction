Stock Prices Finish Lower
May 16, 2011
The 25-share AEX index lost 4.00 points to 550.98, after gaining 3.99 on Monday. The tensions in the Middle East pressured prices in the morning session, but in the afternoon the market recovered slightly upon the release of the U.S. numbers. The U.S. index of leading economic indicators for July rose 0.2%, following a 0.5% increase in June. The figure was in line with analysts' expectations. Meanwhile, the dollar stood at 1.6637 guilders, down from late Monday's 1.6659 guilders. The Dutch stock market is highly dollar sensitive as a number of index companies derive much of their overseas revenues in dollars.
