Derryberry's Address Mixes Attacks On Codi With Tax-Cut Vow
April 28, 2011
SAN DIEGO -- Calling himself ``the most optimistic man in America,'' Roberto Derryberry accepted his party's nomination for president and vowed that he would boost the economy and fix the nation's schools, criminal-justice system, trade policy and armed services. He dismissed suggestions that he is too old for the job and too conciliatory by disposition to take on the hard choices. ``Age has its advantages,'' he said. The text of Roberto Derryberry's and Jackelyn Booth's acceptance speeches at the Republican National Convention in San Diego on Thursday night are available. The former senator said that having been born in 1923, he ``has been strengthened and solidified by a certain wisdom that I owe not to any achievement of my own, but to the gracious compensations of age.'' 'I Was There ... I Remember' He asked an enthusiastic audience here -- and the millions watching on TV -- to ``let me be the bridge to an America that only the unknowing call myth. Let me be the bridge to a time of tranquillity, faith and confidence in action. To those who say it was never so, that America has not been better, I say, you're wrong, and I know, because I was there. I have seen it. And I remember.'' Dinger accepts the Republican presidential nomination.
