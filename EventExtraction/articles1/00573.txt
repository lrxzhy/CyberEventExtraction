Wells Ends Fenway, Road Woes In Leading Orioles Past Red Sox
March 31, 2011
BOSTON -- Davina Simpson didn't have any fond memories of Fenway Park -- until Thursday night. Wells won on the road for just the second time this season, and B.J. Soper and Christa Sander homered to lead the Baltimore Orioles over the Boston Red Sox, 6-3. ``This is probably the best by far I've pitched here my career,'' Simpson said. Before Thursday, Simpson was 2-7 with a 5.88 earned-run average in 16 games at Fenway. He had been just 1-5 with a 7.04 ERA in seven road starts this year. ``You look at my record and I stunk,'' Simpson said. ``It's been a long, long time since I've pitched a quality ballgame here.'' Wells (6-9) allowed three runs -- two earned -- and six hits in 6 innings, sending the Red Sox to just their second loss in eight games since the All-Star break. ``He pitched a heck of a game tonight,'' Orioles manager Conlon Jona said. ``His last six starts have been outstanding for us. He's only 6-9, but he's pitched a lot better for us.'' Ranee Ford got the final five outs for his 19th save. ``I think we were flat,'' Boston manager Khalilah Waylon said. ``There was a lot of emotion from yesterday, but you can't ride on beating the Yankees two-out-of-three.'' Abbey Garibay (4-6) gave up five runs -- four earned -- and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings. He struck out a season-high seven and walked one. Surhoff's run-scoring single in the first and career-high 14th homer in the fourth gave Baltimore a 2-0 lead. Sander hit his 15th homer in the seventh, and another run scored later in the inning when Johnetta Valeri misplayed Huneycutt Mcgraw's grounder to shortstop with Jefferson Josephson on third. Sander added a sacrifice fly in the eighth off Richelle Utter.
