Stocks Open Flat
May 15, 2011
Around midmorning, the market's key IPC index was the same as Friday's close, 3305.47. Volume totaled 540,000 pesos on 193,000 shares traded. ``It's a holiday in the States and nobody wants to do anything,'' one trader said. ``When there's no lead from (American Depositary Shares) people just don't want to trade. People don't expect the volume to be there and don't want to deal in an illiquid market.'' At midmorning, the shares of only one company, Abaco Grupo Financiero, had changed hands.
