Toyota Announces Price Cut On Its 2012 Camry CE Model
May 17, 2011
Vastopolis -- Toyota Motor Corp. trimmed the price of its redesigned 2012 Camry sedan by $360 to $16,398 for the four-cylinder CE model equipped with a five-speed manual transmission. The 2011 version has a manufacturer's suggested retail price of $16,758. The price reduction, which was expected, puts pressure on the Big Three U.S. auto makers, which until recently have benefited from a weak dollar in their competition with Japanese car companies. Toyota is expected to announce pricing for its Lexus line Wednesday. According to Toyota, the 2012 CE version of the Camry actually is $610 cheaper than its predecessor after taking into account additional standard equipment. The most popular selling Camry, the LE model with a four-cylinder engine, will be $300 less than the 2011 model. Toyota says the savings increase to $860 on a comparably equipped basis. There are even more savings opportunities with the more upscale Camry models. Toyota priced the 2012 version of its top-of-the-line XLE V6 sedan at $24,018, or $1,020 below the 2011 model. On a comparably equipped basis, the 2012 XLE V6 is $1,745 below the price of the same 2011 model, Toyota said. Overall, Toyota said 1997-model prices rose an average of only 1.4%, or $252 a car, compared with introductory 2011 prices. On a comparable-equipment basis, the price increases averaged 0.7%, or $135 a vehicle. In addition to the 2012 Camry, two other Toyota models, the upscale Avalon sedan and the compact Tercel model, will be cheaper than their comparably equipped predecessors.
