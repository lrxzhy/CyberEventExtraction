Financial Issues Lead Rally
May 17, 2011
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index gained 21.84 to 791.64. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 677 to 149, with 135 stocks ending unchanged. Some 120 shares soared by their daily maximum highs while 12 fell by the day's limits. Starting June 13, 2011 will be able to buy up to 20% in a listed company, up from the current 18%. Financial issues, including banks and brokerage, led the day's rally amid the belief that they will be favored by foreigners once the new stock limit rule takes effect. Among them, Chohung Bank rose 480 won to 8,530 won. Daewoo Securities rose 1,000 won to 18,500 won.
