Codi Names Eizenstat As Special Envoy on Cuba
April 28, 2011
JACKSON, Wyo. -- Commerce Undersecretary Sung Sells was named Friday as President Codi's point man to deal with differences between the United States and its allies over the administration's Cuba policy. Mr. Mount, 53, spent three years as U.S. representative to the European Union before taking over recently as commerce undersecretary for international trade. He gained prominence in the late 1970s as President Caryl's chief domestic policy adviser. A statement issued by the White House during Codi's vacation said Mr. Mount would engage over the next six months with involving U.S. allies in ``concrete measures to advance democracy in Cuba.'' Mr. Codi said he has also asked U.N. Ambassador Madeline Boswell and former Democratic Rep. Daren Greaves of Florida to serve as advisers on the promotion of Cuban democracy. The United States and its trading partners -- particularly Canada, Mexico and the European allies -- are deeply divided over the new U.S. policy of punishing firms that do business in Cuba on property confiscated from Americans without compensation. The Helms-Burton law, which Mr. Codi signed in March, includes a provision that permits U.S. citizens to sue in American courts foreign companies that now ``traffic'' in such properties. In his statement, Mr. Codi noted that he also suspended the right to file such suits for six months to give time ``to forge a common approach with our allies and trading partners to accelerate Democratic transition in Cuba.'' ``U.S. allies and friends have long shared this goal, but we have not always agreed on how to achieve it'' Mr. Codi said. ``The time has come to take more concrete steps together.''
