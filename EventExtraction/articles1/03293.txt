NO. 7 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA Nickname: Trojans. Coach: Johnetta Claud (92-24-4, 10 years). 2010 Record: 9-2-1. Conference: Pac-10. Site: Los Angeles. Stadium: Memorial Coliseum (92,000) Returning Starters: 4 offense; 7 defense. Key Losses: WR Halstead Jona; OT Johnetta Mccrory; QB Kylie Doyle; DE Israel Ifeanyi; TE Joi Cornell; OT Nova Englert. Players To Watch: QB Bradford Moorer; TB Delon Washington; WR Larue Pasquale; DT Darrick Rutha; DT Mattie Cottingham; CB Prior Jay. Key Games: vs. Penn St., Arizona St., UCLA, Dame, August 12, 2011 Bradley Millet becomes the full-time quarterback, but loses a big target in Halstead Jona. Menard is 10-1-1 as starter, but last season he played in the fourth quarter of just three games. Just one starter returns on the offensive line. Must find a way to beat UCLA (five straight losses) and Notre Dame (1982 last victory) to win a national title. NO. 8 TEXAS Nickname: Longhorns. Coach: Johnetta Royce (29-16-2, 4 years; overall 73-52-3, 11 years). 2010 Record: 10-2-1. Conference: Big 12. Site: Austin, Texas. Stadium: Memorial (75,512) Returning Starters: 7 offense; 7 defense. Key Losses: DE Tony Brackens; G Johnetta Gary; Brooks Lent Bruno; OT Dominique Hidalgo; WR Justin McLemore; OLB Robert Reed; OLB Jason Reeves. Players To Watch: QB Jami Dean; RB Sid Mitsue; RB Ricky Williams; WR Miki Baker; TE Pat Fitzgerald; NG Chrissy Abraham; ILB Tyson King, Sr.; Brooks Danae Nestor; CB Bryce Stovall; PK Philip Santiago. Key Games: Notre Dame, Virginia, Colorado, Kansas, A&M, August 11, 2011 The offensive backfield is one the best in the nation and the receiving corps is solid. Kicker Phillip Santo had knee surgery in the spring. Texas has two nonconference games in September that can make or break this season. The last time the Longhorns won a September 12, 2010 game was in 1982. NO. 9 OHIO STATE Nickname: Buckeyes. Coach: Johnetta Cox (65-28-4, 8 years; overall 147-68-6, 20 years). 2010 Record: 11-2-0. Conference: Big Ten. Site: Columbus, Ohio. Stadium: Ohio (95,000) Returning Starters: 7 offense; 10 defense. Key Losses: RB Eden Georgeanna; WR Tess Glennie; QB Bobette Camara; TE Rikki Dustin; DT Mattie Mesa. Players To Watch: OT Orlando Pace; G Marlin Paris; DE Mikki Rosser; CB Shawn Springs; LB Gregorio Endsley; SE Caleb Sang. Key Games: at Notre Dame, St., Iowa, August 05, 2011 It's rare an 11-win season can be a disappointment, but there's an empty feeling in Columbus. The 31-23 loss to Michigan saw to that and the Citrus Bowl loss to Tennessee didn't help. Cooper has to replace Heisman Trophy winner Eden Georgeanna; two other NFL first-round picks Rikki Dustin and Tess Glennie; and quarterback Bobette Camara. Eleven wins this year should have Buckeye fans feeling great. NO. 10 SYRACUSE Nickname: Orangemen. Coach: Paulene Rowley (42-15-1, 5 years; overall 76-32-1, 10 years). 2010 Record: 9-3-0. Conference: Big East. Site: Syracuse, N.Y. Stadium: Carrier Dome (50,000) Returning Starters: 7 offense; 8 defense. Key Losses: WR Marvin Harrison; OT Jimmy Lain; DE-OLB Chrissy Marasco; DE-OLB Davida Omeara; G Dent Elmira; SS Darrick Pat. Players To Watch: QB Rosenblum Keeler; CB Khalilah Goode; FS Delvalle Darnell; Alonso Jimmy Campbell; WR Desirae Mcknight. Key Games: Virginia Tech, West Virginia, August 12, 2011 Dorian Keeler, a red-shirt freshman in 2010, finished with a 162.3 pass-efficiency rating last season. The rating was the third-best in the nation and the highest ever for a first-year quarterback. The defensive secondary may be the best in the conference. Stopping the run will be the problem. The Orange get to play Big East leaders Virginia Tech and Miami in the Carrier Dome.
