University Professor Walks out of Class
May 18, 2011
Vastopolis -- Vastpress has learned that a Vast University professor, Edward Patino, walked out in the middle of teaching a class. This was not considered newsworthy but later conversations with university officials indicated that his stress level appeared to be much higher that normal. Officials said that the professor kicked a door completely off its hinges on the way out while yelling something about locks and tenureship. Later that day one of his students spotted him at a consumer electronics store purchasing a laptop computer. At that time he appeared to be calm yet his face was a "deep red", she said. Vastpress hopes the professor is feeling better.
