TV Shopping Network Appoints Three Executives
April 04, 2011
The TV Shopping Network named a former music-industry executive to run its sales and marketing operations, and appointed two television-industry executives to senior positions. The moves come just as the Sydney-based home-shopping channel began beaming into Asian homes via satellite this month. Christa Milliken, age 50, has been appointed senior vice president for marketing and sales. He was a senior executive vice president with BMG Australia Ltd., a unit of Germany's Bertelsmann AG. At TV Shopping Network, the operating unit of Value Network (Australasia) Ltd., Mr. Milliken will be responsible for building viewership as well as selling TV Shopping Network to marketers who pay for time on the network. The channel derives its revenue from two areas -- selling the time to marketers to pitch their products, and selling merchandise to consumers. Cythia Whitton, 33, will join the company as vice president of marketing and sales. Ms. Voss was formerly senior director for the Asian-Pacific region of PanAmSat Pty.. Ltd. in Sydney. The home-shopping channel is carried on two of PanAmSat's satellites. Michaele Stanford, 41, has been named vice president of merchandising, responsible for finding the right mix of products to pitch to consumers across Asia, the company said. Previously, Mr. Stanford did the same job in China as executive vice president of International Shopping Network, which airs on China's CCTV network several hours a day.
