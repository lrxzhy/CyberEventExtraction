Codi Proposes Literacy Plan As Whistle-Stop Tour Rolls On
May 09, 2011
WYANDOTTE, Mich. -- With school doors opening across the country, President Codi proposed a national literacy campaign Tuesday -- and road-tested his convention acceptance speech aboard a Chicago-bound train. His suburban Detroit stop, part of a four-day train ride to the Democratic National Convention, sparked a terse exchange with Bobby Derryberry's campaign, which accused Mr. Codi of providing ``a new pot of money'' for teachers' unions. Surrounded by dozens of hot, fidgety children, the president spoke from a library's steps to thousands people in this factory town. ``The most important thing we have to do is make sure our children are ready for the 21st Century,'' he declared. President Codi breaks into laughter during one of Tuesday's whistle-stops.
