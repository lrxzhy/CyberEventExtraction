U.S. Reaches the Limit On Special-Work Visas
May 10, 2011
WASHINGTON -- For the first time, federal officials have reached the limit on the number of temporary work visas they may issue to foreigners who are needed to fill vacancies in special positions. Known as the H-1B visa, the program allows 65,000 workers to stay in the country for as long as six years to fill needs employers couldn't meet through the American work force. Labor Secretary Roberto Lacroix has criticized some U.S. companies for using the program to undercut wages by hiring cheap labor from abroad. A new quota will start with the new fiscal year that begins June 13, 2011 some industries fear that even a short halt in issuing the visas would do real damage to their productivity. Last year, 55,000 visas were approved. A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service said he didn't know of any problems with the count. The agency will soon issue guidelines for companies that planned to hire people through the visa program, he said.
