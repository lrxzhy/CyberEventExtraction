VastComm Network to Offer Businesses A Phone Link to Web Users
May 09, 2011
Downtown -- VastComm Network Corp. is expected to announce new technology Tuesday that will enable businesses to telephone customers visiting their Web sites, executives familiar with the plans said. The new technology, dubbed ``instant Answers,'' allows World Wide Web users to request a phone call from a company sales or service agent by clicking a button labeled ``Call me now,'' on a Web page. The sales agent would be able to ``push'' any additional requested information directly to the consumer over the Web. The move is an attempt to beef up VastComm Network's 800-number business. The company hopes that businesses that use VastComm Network's toll-free service will also opt to have the telecommunications giant host their Web sites. Separately, VastComm Network said subscribers to its WorldNet Internet-access service can now also link up to America Online Inc. at a 20% discount off AOL's standard rates. That means WorldNet users can spend five hours each month on AOL for $7.95 -- or 20 hours for $15.95 -- plus $2.35 for each extra hour. However, users must also pay for time on WorldNet when they use it to reach AOL.
