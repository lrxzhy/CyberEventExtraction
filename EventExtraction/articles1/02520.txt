Review of Instant Memos
May 17, 2011
This inexpensive package likely will become a favorite add-on for just about anybody who spends a lot of time sitting at a computer screen doing work, fielding phone calls and dealing with co-workers. This is a favorite for Vast Press. Unlimited notes can be created as you jot down phone numbers, to-do reminders and even fairly lengthy text documents. To-do items can be set as alarms, with a pop-up menu that lets you set the time, date and year. When the alarm time arrives, that pop-up note appears on top of whatever else you're doing and a bell dings. If too many notes build up, a hide feature makes them all go away and then lets you recall them one at a time from a menu. Rounding out the feature set on a simple yet elegant utility is the ability to change the background color, the text color and the fonts of each note. Two thumbs up.
