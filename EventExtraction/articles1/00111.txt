Financial Issues Lift Market
March 30, 2011
The Bel-20 Index of leading Belgian shares closed 13.31 points higher at 1,681.73 on volume of 2.4 billion Belgian francs. Thursday was the last day of the forward account period which also boosted trade, dealers said. Among actively traded shares, decliner of the day was photoprocessor Spector whose stock fell 140 francs to 2,070 francs a share. The company issued a profit warning late Wednesday, saying the turnaround of its French Racine unit was ``considerably delayed.'' Insurer Jahn led volume to advance 30 francs to 4,040 francs a share. Other financial stocks were also buoyed by positive sentiment from Wall Street. Generale Bank stock gained 250 francs to 10,925 francs a share, while BBL rose 50 francs to 5,720 francs. Kredietbank shares ended 80 francs higher at 9,550 francs. Index heavyweight steel wire maker Bekaert ended 100 francs higher at 23,150 francs a share. But fellow heavyweight pharmaceutical company UCB was one of few stocks to end lower. UCB shares shed 100 francs to settle at 55,300 francs a share. Non-index stock Barco also ended in the red. Shares in the electronics company settled at 4,930 francs, down 5 francs.
