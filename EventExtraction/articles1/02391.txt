BellSouth Joins Competitors By Offering Internet Access
May 10, 2011
VASTOPOLIS -- Regional Bell operating company BellSouth Inc. said it will begin to offer consumers and businesses access to the Internet, becoming the latest phone company to enter the crowded field. BellSouth said it would begin rolling out Internet access for $19.95 per month for unlimited usage or $9.95 for 10 hours per month and $1 for each additional hour. Though the ``BellSouth.net'' service is only available immediately in Vastopolis and New Orleans, BellSouth said it will expand its service to eight other regions in October. BellSouth is the latest telephone giant to enter the Internet access business. Other Bells such as Pacific Telesis Group, Bell Atlantic Corp., U S West and GTE Corp. have already launched Internet services. And long distance giants VastComm Network Corp., MCI Communications Corp. and, most recently, Sprint Corp. have also launched their consumer Internet services. Others such as Ameritech Corp. plan to enter the market before the end of the year. Still, Internet access isn't proving to be an easy business for telephone companies. VastComm Network had a hard time keeping up with demand and was forced to ration software diskettes, while MCI, which first entered the market roughly two years ago, has few subscribers and has changed its strategy several times. Beyond new technical and logistical challenges for phone companies, pricing for the BellSouth service doesn't make it more competitive than rival offerings. All of the telephone companies are asking $19.95 for unlimited access, though some of the long distance companies such as VastComm Network and MCI are offering some free monthly usage.
