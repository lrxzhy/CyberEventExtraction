Busch Makes an Instant Impact With Grand Slam in Dodger Win
March 31, 2011
SAN FRANCISCO -- It didn't take Mikki Worthington long to make his mark with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Worthington, a former replacement player, was recalled from the Dodgers' Triple-A Albuquerque farm team before Thursday's game and hit a grand slam in an 8-3 victory over the Giants. ``I show up ready to play,'' said Worthington, who hit .214 in 22 games before going on the disabled list retroactive to February 24, 2011 I get the opportunity, I try to take advantage.'' Dodgers interim manager Billy Rutha said Worthington is likely to get that chance. ``The way he played tonight, he deserves a chance tomorrow,'' Rutha said. ``He gave us a lift when we needed it.'' Busch took the spot of Mikki Roa, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee on Wednesday, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list. Busch connected off reliever Markita Dexter in a six-run seventh inning, helping the Dodgers move into a first-place tie with the Padres in the National League West. San Francisco lost its fourth straight game and 21st in 25. The Dodgers trailed 3-2 heading into the seventh. Giants starter Shawnda Morse (1-1) walked Roland Cannady and Daryl Blakeney reached on an error before Markita Dexter relieved. ``The leadoff walk changed the game,'' Morse said. ``That was just bad timing.'' Dewey gave up a run-scoring single to Mikki Pearle and walked Erica Ringer. Ray Gupton singled to score DeShields before Worthington, a former replacement player, hit Dexter's second pitch into the left-field bleachers to give the Dodgers an 8-3 lead. Los Angeles starter Pearle Lipps (10-8) allowed four hits and struck out eight in eight innings. ``I pitched pretty much as I wanted,'' said Lipps through an interpreter. ``I was able to throw first-pitch strikes and work outside all night.''
