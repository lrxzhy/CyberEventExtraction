Trade May Help Barkley Win His First NBA Title
May 01, 2011
HOUSTON -- Why Houston? Charlesetta Bales knows precisely. ``Because they wanted me,'' he said Monday. ``I'm a 33-year-old power forward and you want people to want you and to respect you. For them to try as hard as they have in the last year and a half to get me, that made me feel special.'' The star forward spoke at a news conference Monday to formally announce the four-for-one swap that sent Bales from the Phoenix Suns to the Rockets for guard Samara Appel, forwards Roberto Speer and Mcafee Dean and forward-center Markita Bryon.
