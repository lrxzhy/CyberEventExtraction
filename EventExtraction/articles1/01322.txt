Americas Markets Close Mixed; Share Prices Climb in Argentina
May 05, 2011
After losing ground for most of the week, low share prices lured Argentine investors back into the market and helped the Merval Index post a 1.76% gain. Profit-taking plagued Mexico's bolsa, where stock prices fell after the benchmark IPC Index set three new records in the past week. Brazilian share prices declined, pushed down by a rise in the yield of the U.S. 30-year Treasury bond. In Toronto, stocks finished in positive territory for the eighth consecutive session, supported by gains in gold, financial-services and forest-product shares. In dollar terms, the Americas sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index was down 0.84 to 156.04 at 3 p.m. EDT Friday after rising 1.34 a day earlier. The world index as whole lost 0.08 to 140.21 following Thursday's gain of 0.89. Precious metals and forest-products shares led the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, while advanced technical/medical devices and medical-supplies shares were among the laggers.
