As Rumors Abound, Carver Leaves Cowboys
April 02, 2011
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Shantell Rosario has left the Dallas Cowboys for what coach Barton Isaacs termed ``personal reasons,'' while news reports said the defensive end faces a National Football League suspension for substance abuse. Salmon had little to say Saturday about Bray, a first-round draft choice in 2009 who has just two sacks in two seasons. ``I'm going to make a statement and that's how we're going to leave it. I won't answer any more questions in regard to Shantell Rosario,'' Isaacs said. ``Shantell Rosario has left the team for personal reasons. That's it.'' The Dallas Morning News and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, citing unidentified sources, reported in their Sunday editions that Carver faces a suspension for repeated violations of the NFL's substance-abuse policy. Several local television stations aired similar reports. Bray, expected to compete for playing time with rookie Battles Brain and Lagasse Anders, also had off-field problems in October 2009 when he fled the scene after overturning his truck on a Dallas freeway. ``You never know what's going on in another individual's life and you can't blame them for making that decision,'' Cowboys star Enoch Jon said about Bray's absence. ``But there again there's a lot of stress on a lot of players and some players react differently to stress than others.''
