Bookshelf Guilt or Innocence Under a Microscope
May 17, 2011
The mother of a seven-year-old daughter is awakened by a man hovering over her in the dark. When he kisses her, she realizes it is her estranged boyfriend who has beaten her many times. Although she pleads with him, he covers her head with a pillowcase and rapes her. The boyfriend is arrested. He has no alibi. But when DNA tests of a semen deposit come back, there is no match. Prosecutors are dumbfounded. The boyfriend, however, reports that while in jail he encountered an acquaintance who ``looks like my brother'' and who once dated his girl friend's former roommate. The man gave him a ``funny look'' when told about the rape. Other leads point to this new suspect and when a DNA sample is taken, there is a match. An innocent man is spared an almost certain conviction while the real criminal goes to jail--even though the victim remains convinced to the end that her boyfriend was the attacker. Harland David
