Americas Stocks End Higher; Economy Hopes Boost Mexico
April 27, 2011
Mexican stocks soared on growing expectations of economic recovery and speculation that second-quarter growth figures would be released several days early and would be far better than expected. Canadian share prices advanced, spurred on by strength in natural-resource stocks and the latest drill results from Bema Gold's gold and copper prospect in northern Chile, which sparked a feeding frenzy. In Argentina, shares posted sharp gains as the market responded enthusiastically to signs the government is finally finding support for recently announced fiscal austerity measures. Brazilian stocks rose, helped by the Argentina government's decision to privatize the giant Yacyreta dam, which is seen as a stimulus for Brazil to speed up its own privatization program.
