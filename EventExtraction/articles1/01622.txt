Trading Focuses on Small Stocks
April 26, 2011
An absence of market-moving news forced investors to the sidelines, causing trading volume to be light. The key Composite Index, which is made up of 100 blue-chip stocks, lost 2.79 to 1102.56. Advancers led decliners by 252 to 251, while 165 shares were unchanged and 90 untraded. Volume stood at 162.1 million shares, valued at 1.24 billion ringgit. The day's trading activity remained focused on smaller second-tier shares, mostly liked by retail investors. Blue chips ended mixed to lower. Power utility Tenaga Nasional fell 20 sen to 9.05 ringgit. Malayan Banking was unchanged at 22.90 ringgit. But motor-vehicle trader UMW Holdings' rise managed to lend some support to the composite index. The stock rose 40 sen to 9.90 ringgit after reporting its interim net profit more than doubled to 92.7 million ringgit from 43.8 million ringgit the year before.
