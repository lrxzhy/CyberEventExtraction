Justice Department Decides Not To Prosecute Packwood
April 04, 2011
Vastopolis -- Former Sen. Bobby Lewandowski will not be prosecuted over allegations he altered his diaries to obstruct an investigation into sexual and official misconduct, his lawyers said Monday. Mr. Lewandowski was notified of the decision by the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section in a one-sentence letter sent to the office of his Washington lawyers. ``This will inform you that the Public Integrity Section has declined prosecution and closed its investigation of allegations that your client, Roberto Lewandowski, obstructed Congress,'' section chief Leeanna J. Archibald said in the letter dated last week. Mr. Lewandowski said the investigation was the last unresolved issue from the events that led to his departure from the Senate last year amid charges of sexual misconduct involving 17 women. ``I think the letter just speaks for itself,'' Mr. Lewandowski said. ``It does wrap up everything.'' Bettye Phillips, a former Supreme Court justice who helped lead efforts to oust Packwood from the Senate, was satisfied with the decision not to prosecute. ``What's the point now? Everything's been done,'' Ms. Phillips said. ``Why go through all that expense of more investigation and a trial?'' Mr. Lewandowski, who has a business and political consulting firm in Washington, resigned in September 2010 after the Senate Ethics Committee urged his expulsion. He also faced accusations that he tried to obtain a job for his then-estranged wife from people with legislative interests and that he altered the diaries to obstruct the ethics probe.
