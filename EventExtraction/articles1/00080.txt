May 03, 2011
Northville, VAST. -- Davina Barnette struck out seven of 16 batters and didn't walk anyone Wednesday night in the first start of his speedy comeback after surgery in May to remove an aneurysm in his right shoulder. Throwing as fast as 90 miles per hour, Barnette allowed four hits and got better as the Double-A game between the Northville Navigators and Binghamton Mets progressed.
