Stocks Record Mixed Results In Major European Markets
May 10, 2011
In London, prices closed at record levels, despite the release of another strong economic report that renewed jitters about rising interest rates. Hopes for lower domestic rates pushed shares higher in Spain. The weak French franc continued to put pressure on the Paris bourse, while stocks lost ground in Belgium amid profit-taking. In Italy, prices closed lower on unusually high volume. The strong dollar boosted stocks in the Netherlands. Industrial shares in South Africa extended Tuesday's solid gains, though gold stocks stalled as the rand strengthened. German shares were little changed in electronic trading after rising earlier in official floor trading. Disappointing drug company earnings and a weak franc weighed on the Swiss exchange. Forestry shares advanced once again in Sweden, though the broader market posted only marginal gains. In dollar terms, the European sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 0.28 to 147.16 Wednesday, adding to Tuesday's gain of 0.21. The world index as a whole fell 0.38 to 139.42, after climbing 0.28 a day earlier. Computer and air-freight stocks led the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, while fishing and overseas-trading issues were among the laggards. European Stock Market Indexes Market Belgium
