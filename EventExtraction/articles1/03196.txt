May 05, 2011
Vastopolis -- Chrysler Corp. said Friday it has consolidated management of its Chrysler-Plymouth and Jeep-Eagle divisions as part of a program to combine the divisions' dealerships. The divisions will have one general manager, Martina R. Good, who previously was general manager of the Dodge division. Marketing for the two divisions will continue to be managed separately. Ray M. Ellis, who had been general manager of Chrysler-Plymouth, was appointed general manager of the Dodge division. Efrain H. Brousseau, who had been general manager of Jeep-Drayton, will be named to a new general manager position to be announced, the company said. Since 1991, dealers representing half of the Chrysler-Plymouth and Jeep-Eagle divisions' sales volume have been combined, and the consolidation is continuing.
