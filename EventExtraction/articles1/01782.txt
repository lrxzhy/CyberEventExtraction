Lack of Leaders Damps Stocks
April 29, 2011
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 4.27 to 810.69 in thin trading of 10.6 million shares valued at 204.2 billion won. Decliners led advancers 469 to 308, with 161 ending unchanged. ``There were no fresh factors that could pull up the market,'' said Gorski Byung-Hector, an analyst with Coryo Securities. ``Lack of the leading group of shares also depressed the market.'' Reports of weak first-half earnings also hurt the market, analysts said. Blue chips lost ground. Pohang Iron & Steel fell by 700 won to 50,500 won while Korea Electric Power declined 300 won to 25,800 won and Samsung Electronics shed 1,000 won to 70,900 won. Advancing sectors included fishing, wood, transport equipment and transportation companies, analysts said.
