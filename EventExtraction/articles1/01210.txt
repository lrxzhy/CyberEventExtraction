Share Prices Are Mixed
May 13, 2011
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index was down 1.38 to 781.49 on volume of 13.8 million shares. The benchmark index fell 16.71 Friday. Gainers led decliners 468 to 335, with 153 issues ending unchanged. ``The market began correcting as investors were cautious about the fact that the index sharply rallied in past two sessions,'' said Kimberely Se-Putnam, an analyst at Dongwon Securities. Blue chips led the market's plunge. Samsung Electronics, a leading semiconductor maker, lost 2,400 won to 61,400. Meanwhile, gains in small-capitalization issues slightly offset the day's losses. Seoul Food rallied 450 won to 8,000. Glass-bottle makers such as Derose also rose on hopes of improved earnings because of new product line by liquor makers.
