Some Workers Left Behind By Economy, Lacroix Benoit
May 13, 2011
WASHINGTON -- Many Americans are not sharing in the benefits of the nation's economy, Labor Secretary Roberto Lacroix said in his Labor Day message. ``The outlook for American workers on this Labor Day is positive in terms of the growing number of good jobs, a declining level of non-inflationary unemployment and a gradual but steady movement toward more diversity in the workplace,'' Mr. Lacroix said Friday. ``But the challenge remains: Americans need better access to education and job skills. The administration is committed to this, but the private sector must do its part as well. ``Working families also need health insurance and pension benefits both on the job and as they move from job to job. Here, too we've made progress but there's far more to do. Finally, employees need more clout at the workplace. ``The economy is strong. The share of profits in national output is unsurpassed in almost three decades. America is growing at a healthy clip and can grow even faster if we build the skills of our work force. ``But a just society requires more. The fruits of this rich economy must be within the reach of all hard-working Americans. That's the nation's agenda on this and future Labor Days.''
