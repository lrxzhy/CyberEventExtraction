Choice GOP Tchotchkes For Your Home or Office
April 27, 2011
Meanwhile, here is today's sampling of knickknacks that no GOP home-office or den should be without: Time for a change? This wall clock from Gerald Sears-West features the faces of Republican presidents from Grant to Vern. ``Be the first on your block to own a Republican clock,'' urges the maker. Hey -- it's half past Ashli! Is Steve Case a Republican? Here's the evidence: A custom version of America Online software is available in the Convention Center's Internet Alley. Both the Disc and envelope are decorated with Republican-type images. Obvious questions: Once on-line, will the user be able to access any liberal media web sites? William Stevie be changing his registration for Chicago? And when do we see see a disk with Royce Nail's mug? Once Mr. or Mrs. Republican have installed the America Online software, this Dinger mousepad will come in handy. The surface is smooth, but never slick. This popular souvenir, from Political Americana from Washington, D.C., sold out by Tuesday. It may be Whitewater to you, but here it's Jonas, the board game. Players start at the south gate and move through the White House trying to find missing documents such as billing records from the ``Rosey Law Firm,'' Travel Office documents or Vincent's files. The game, designed by Donya Spears of Covington, La., even includes a bag of shredded files -- likely a sign the player has lost. Still looking for that perfect something to enliven your own Grand Old Party? More items are available for your viewing pleasure. Photos for the Interactive Edition by Loria Wilton Bart
