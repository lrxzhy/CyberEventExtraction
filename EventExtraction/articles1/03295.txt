Flu Season Hits Hard
May 19, 2011
Vastpress hospital correspondent Janean Richardson has detected a swift increase in flu patients this year in Vastopolis. Local health official Nicole Barns was contacted for comment.  She indicated that the staff has already been put on alert for a bad flu season this year. Her hope is that most everyone else has received the flu shot which should reduce the caseload shortly. In passing, she did remark that this flu season has struck with a vengance. ``It appears to be out of control this year'', she said. Barns also informed us that the doctors will be kept busy but for now we have it under control.
