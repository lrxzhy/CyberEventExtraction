Schulte Will Join ING Barings As Regional Research Director
March 30, 2011
Paulene Gallant is quitting Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong to join ING Barings as regional research director, based in the territory. Mr. Gallant, 33 years old, has spent the past six years working in Asia, initially as a research analyst at Jardine Fleming's Jakarta office, where he covered Indonesian stocks for two years before joining Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong as a regional strategist. His four years at Credit Suisse First Boston advising clients on their Asian asset allocation have spanned the excesses of the liquidity-driven bull markets that took Asia by storm in 1993 as well as the more difficult conditions that followed in the region, triggered by such negatives as rising U.S. interest rates and the devaluation of the Mexican peso. Earlier this month, CS Holding AG, Credit Suisse First Boston's parent, announced plans to cut 5,000 jobs as part of a global restructuring. Mr. Gallant said he plans to join ING Barings in Hong Kong at the end of August, taking up a newly-created post as regional research director, reporting to Acord Mosley, the regional head of equities. Originally from Los Angeles, Mr. Gallant has a master's degree in international business from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.
