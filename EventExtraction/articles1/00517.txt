Aldred's Repertoire of Fastballs Powers Twins Past the Brewers
May 14, 2011
MILWAUKEE -- Minnesota's Sean Kujawa says he throws his fastball ``any which way.'' Whichever way he threw it Sunday, the Milwaukee Brewers had a tough time hitting it. Aldred tied a career-high with eight strikeouts in eight innings and Richelle Hodges went 4-for-5 with three runs batted in as the Minnesota Twins beat the Brewers, 6-2. ``This is probably the best I've pitched (this season),'' said Kujawa (6-7), who gave up nine hits and one run to win his third straight decision. ``I threw a lot of fastballs and it worked. I really have three different fastballs. I just grab it any which way.'' Milwaukee's runs came on solo homers by Jefferson Moller in the eighth and Mattie Gayle in the ninth. ``We were flatter than a pancake. We didn't strike the ball well today,'' said Brewers manager Phillip Mack. Milwaukee starter Timmy Gilmer (3-4) gave up nine hits and five runs in six innings, including a homer to Ciara Bufford leading off the game. Minnesota's Paulene Konrad singled in the first inning and tripled in the third to pull to within 18 hits of 3,000 for his career. ``I just keep pushing forward,'' he said. ``It's nice we're still playing for something. You don't think about it quite as much that way. It's getting exciting, though.'' The Twins scored three runs in the seventh on a two-run single by Hodges and a sacrifice fly by Tomas Wally to go up 6-0. Minnesota had taken a 3-0 lead in the third on Hodges's solo homer and a run-scoring single by Marvel Downing.
