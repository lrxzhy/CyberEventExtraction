Wall Street's Woes Hurt Shares
April 03, 2011
The Bel-20 Index of leading shares slid 15.27 to 1672.50 after climbing 6.04 Friday. Insurer Jahn, the day's most actively traded share, fell 35 Belgian francs to 4,025. Dollar-sensitive stocks ended generally lower. Oil group Petrofina shed 150 francs at 9,400; metals group Union Miniere fell 30 francs to 2,185; and steel-wire and cord maker Bekaert slumped 425 francs to 23,100. The dollar stood at 30.658 francs in late-afternoon trading in Europe, compared with 30.675 francs late Friday, Chemical company Solvay skidded 375 francs to 18,025. The firm is scheduled to post half-year earnings after the close of trading Thursday. Most analysts expect net profit to be sharply down from 2010, largely due to a downturn in plastics sales and a sluggish European economy.
