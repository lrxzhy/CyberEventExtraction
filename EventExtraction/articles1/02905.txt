Share Prices Move Higher
May 10, 2011
Dutch publisher VNU closed at 30.00 guilders, up 90 Dutch cents after reporting Tuesday that six-month earnings before extraordinary items rose 13% to 143 million guilders. Food company Nutricia continued its rally, benefiting from last week's news that its first-half profit rose 51% to 107.1 million guilders in the first half of 2011 and turnover increased 72.4% to 1.4 billion guilders. Nutricia ended the day 4.90 guilders higher to 228.60 guilders. Food and drink company BolsWessanen closed at 27.50 guilders, down 90 Dutch cents. The company said Wednesday that its net profit fell 27% in the first half of 2011 to 63.5 million guilders, mainly because of worsening performance of its cereals activities, lower exports of spirits and margin pressure at its U.S. dairy operations. The profit was slightly below market expectations. Industrial machinery group Stork also reported earnings Wednesday, saying its net profit rose 21.7% in the first half of 2011 to 40.4 million guilders compared to the same period last year, while turnover decreased 7.6% to 1.41 billion guilders due to lower sales at its Industrial Systems and Components division. Stork closed at 52.00 guilders, down 90 Dutch cents.
