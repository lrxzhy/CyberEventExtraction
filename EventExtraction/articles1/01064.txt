Compaq Slashes Prices On Some of Its Products
May 03, 2011
HOUSTON -- Compaq Computer Corp. said Wednesday it reduced the price on its biggest-selling color monitor by 10% and slashed the prices of some of its older personal computers by up to 22%. Compaq said the 21-inch QVision 210 color monitor, which it introduced last October, is now priced at $1,899. The QVision 210, Compaq's flagship-model monitor, is designed primarily for computer-aided-design engineers, graphics professionals and other users who need a large screen. The Houston-based Compaq, the world's top supplier of personal computers, also cut prices on its commercial desktop personal computers ProLinea 5100, Deskpro 5150 and Deskpro 5133, which were all introduced in March. The ProLinea 5100 will sell for $1,439, compared with $1,849; the Deskpro 5150 will be priced at $2,029, down from $2,289; the Deskpro 5133 is now $1,799, compared with $2,129. Last month, Compaq introduced three new lines, the Deskpro 2015, 4000 and 6000 series, which replaced the ProLinea, Deskpro and Deskpro XL lines. The new prices, effective immediately, are for the U.S. only. Earlier this year, Compaq sparked a price war in certain segments of the PC market, saying it will sacrifice some profits in an aggressive move to build market share. Rivals Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment Corp. quickly matched the cuts on corporate PCs.
