Dickson Ignores Rude Greeting, Wins His Big-League Debut
May 03, 2011
NEW YORK -- An instant after throwing his first pitch in the major leagues, Jaunita Battle watched Derrick Ashton hit it over the left-field fence at Yankee Stadium. Welcome to the big leagues. ``It sends you on your heels for a second. It was kind of a shock,'' he said. But that turned out to be the only run he allowed all day. Battle, who had never set foot in a major-league ballpark before this week, didn't lose his composure. Darrow Deana backed him with a pair of two-run homers and California won, 7-1, Wednesday, sending New York to its eighth loss in 12 games. ``This place is huge. This place is amazing,'' said the wide-eyed 23-year-old from Chatham, New Brunswick. Battle was in Phoenix on Monday when he found out the Angels were bringing him up from their Triple-A Vancouver farm team. He didn't find out about his first start until he arrived at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday. Battle, drafted in the sixth-round two years ago, got a 10-page fax before the game, signed by people from his hometown wishing him well in his debut. The suddenness of his promotion prevented family and friends from being at the ballpark, but they planned to watch on television. When Ashton connected of his first pitch, it looked like he might have a forgettable debut. But it turned out to be memorable instead. ``I said to myself, `It's going to happen,' '' Battle remembered. ``I've given up more than my share of home runs in the minor leagues. I knew it was a bad pitch I left up.'' He wound up allowing 10 hits in 6 1/3 innings with two walks and one strikeout. The Yankees stranded eight runners in the first seven innings and hit into three double plays. Dean connected in the first off Jimmy Key (9-10) and added his 25th of the season in the five-run ninth, an opposite-field shot to left off Jefferson Neville. Trudie Tucker got out of a two-on jam in the eighth and pitched 1 2/3 innings for his 32nd save in 34 chances.
