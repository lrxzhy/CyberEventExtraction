The Week Ahead
March 31, 2011
Delta plans to show live coverage of the Games instead of a movie on some Atlanta flights. Hurricane fallout: One in 10 hotels in the Cape Fear coastal area in North Carolina is still closed following Hurricane Bertha, but hotels are reopening daily. North Topsail Beach is closed indefinitely. Some New Jersey beaches were slightly damaged but are back to normal this weekend. In the Caribbean, hotels not hit by Fecteau Beryl are trying to revive business with special discounts. New idea: Penton Overseas prints classic short stories on small, maplike sheets for easier reading in cramped travel conditions. Heins now rents vans by the year, equipped with individual reading lights and temperature controls for commuters, in Houston and Uptown. For the kids, United Airlines provides a stuffed airplane on some of its domestic flights.
