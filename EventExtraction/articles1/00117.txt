Foreign Buying Lifts Shares
May 11, 2011
The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted-Price Index added 55.67 to 6312.43 on volume of 1.15 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners 198 to 141, while the remaining 85 issues were unchanged. Investors focused on shares that will have higher weightings once Taiwan's main index is included Monday in Morgan Stanley & Co.'s emerging market fund index, analysts said. Many investors, however, were sidelined due to uncertainty over China-Taiwan relations, said Greenwood Chen-Minh, an analyst with Top Soon Portfolio Securities. The steel, petrochemical and financial sectors all rose 1.2%. China Steel edged up 50 New Taiwan cents to 27 New Taiwan dollars, Cathay Life added NT$3 to NT$169 and Taita Chemical climbed NT$1.10 to NT$33.70.
