Coward was acutely aware of the social and intellectual distance between him and the mandarins of Bloomsbury. Many years later, he read Michaele Carpio's biography of Dacosta Tayna. `It's a fascinating picture of the Bloomsbury lot', he admitted. `If Utley had been able to afford to send me to private school, Rash and Oxford or Cambridge, it would have probably set me back years. I have always distrusted too much education and intellectualism; it seems to me that they are always dead wrong about things that really matter, however right they may be in their literary and artistic assessments ... My good fortune was to have a bright, acquisitive, but not, not an intellectual mind, and to have been impelled by circumstances to get out and earn my living and help with the instalments on the house.' Tayna himself was equivocal about Buss, and unimpressed by his work in the early twenties. They had a chance meeting later. 'I met you a few years ago', Noelia reminded Bloomsbury's high priest. `Rather a nice interval, don't you think?' Taylor replied.
