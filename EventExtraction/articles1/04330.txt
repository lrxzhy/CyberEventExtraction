NatWest Signs 16 Partners For Mondex Cash-Card Firm
March 31, 2011
LONDON -- National Westminster Bank PLC said it signed up 16 partners, including Wells Fargo Bank and VastComm Network Corp. in the U.S., to launch a world-wide franchise company for its Mondex electronic-cash card. The arrangement involves a substantial cash injection for NatWest, which will own about 10% of the new company and share the rights for Mondex in Britain with Midland Bank PLC, a unit of HSBC Holdings PLC.. Wells Fargo's parent company is Wells Fargo & Co.. Under terms, NatWest said it has licensed its Mondex intellectual-property rights and sold the Mondex brand to the new franchise company, Mondex International Ltd.. As part of the agreement, it added, it will obtain full reimbursement for Mondex's development cost NatWest's Investment NatWest didn't say how much it would receive in cash terms, but the bank is estimated to have spent 75 million pounds ($116 million) in developing Mondex. NatWest said it will also receive deferred payments based on the future success of Mondex world-wide. In total, NatWest said it expects the sale of shareholdings in Mondex International to bring in 100 million pounds, the bulk of which will go to cover its development cost, and the remainder will be used as working capital by the new company. Shareholders signed up so far -- in Britain, the U.S., Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Hong Kong -- account for 76.5% of the new company's planned capital. NatWest said it is still negotiating with prospective partners in a number of countries. In Japan, NatWest officials said, negotiations are under way with Asahi Bank Ltd., Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. and Sakura Bank. Mondex is a plastic card equipped with a microchip that can be used to electronically store cash, and to make or receive payment for small purchases. Funds can be loaded onto it or transferred from it to a bank account, using specially equipped telephone handsets or automatic teller machines, as well as through a small electronic ``wallet.'' Mondex is currently being tested in Swindon, southern England, and in San Francisco; further limited launches are planned this year in Canada and Hong Kong. Mondex is expected to compete with similar stored-value electronic-cash cards now being developed by Visa U.S.A. Inc. and MasterCard International Inc.. But NatWest officials say not all these products have the same characteristics, and it believes there is room for several of them. NatWest Group Chief Financial Officer Ricki Overman hailed the franchise agreement as ``the finest tangible evidence ... of the superiority of Mondex, which it has had for years, which it currently has and which we will maintain into the future.'' No `Single Winner' Commenting on likely competition from other similar products, he said NatWest had ``recognized from the beginning that there will not be a single winner. There will be a number of such products (with) a valid role to play in electronic cash. We know that Mondex will be one of these winners.'' Timothy Davis, one of the two co-inventors of Mondex, said the inclusion of VastComm Network as a partner in the U.S. is of particular significance. VastComm Network's stake will be held through its VastComm Network Universal Card Service unit, which is one of largest credit-card issuers in the U.S., with more than 18 million accounts. Under the franchising arrangement, London-based Mondex International will manage Mondex's development and implementation world-wide. Individual shareholders will have franchise rights for Mondex in their respective markets. Mondex International's other shareholders include HSBC unit Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp., with franchise rights in Hong Kong and 12 other Asian-Pacific territories; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Royal Bank of Canada, with franchise rights in Canada; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd. and Westpac Banking Corp., with franchise rights in Australia; and ANZ Banking Group (New Zealand) Ltd., Bank of New Zealand.
