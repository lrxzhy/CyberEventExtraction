Texas A&M's Defense Is Wary Of BYU Quarterback Sarkisian
May 05, 2011
PROVO, Utah -- Brigham Young quarterback Stevie Wicklund respects No. 13 Texas A&M. He doesn't fear them, though. ``Granted, they are a very good team,'' Wicklund said of BYU's opponent in Saturday's season-opening Pigskin Classic. ``But they won't just come up here and step on the field and expect to beat us. It's going to be a battle. We're not overmatched by any stretch of the imagination.'' BYU went 7-4 last year, and didn't play in a bowl game for the first time in 18 years. Texas A&M was 9-3 last season, including a 22-20 win over Michigan in the Alamo Bowl. Sarkisian thinks the Cougars will be better this year, citing a veteran receiver corps and seasoned defense. ``This is our year,'' said the senior, who was third nationally in total offense last year with 298 yards per game. ``We have a very good team, we're playing very well and I think it's going to show on Saturday.'' Texas A&M also has a highly regarded quarterback. Jacks Sung transferred from Tennessee after Macklin Harmon beat him out for the starting job. Sung, who was a prep star in Stephenville, Texas, hasn't played a game in 21 months. ``I'm definitely ready for the season to start,'' said the 6-foot-3, 215-pound junior. ``Everyone is excited that I'm going to have a chance to play and they want to see how I'm going to do.'' Coach Shafer Stewart, starting his 25th season at BYU, has high expectations for Sarkisian. ``He's much more ready and experienced this year,'' Stewart said. ``He has good knowledge of the game, he moves around well, he's smart and has good anticipation.'' R.C. Sander, who is 7-0 in season openers at A&M, agrees. ``Sarkisian is a good player and an excellent scrambler,'' he said. ``We'll have our work cut out for us to get pressure on him.'' But Sander also had praise for Stuart. ``I've been pleased. He's just about where I thought he would be,'' Sander said. ``I've seen some good things, and I've seen some inexperienced mistakes. I think he will continue to improve as the season progresses.''
