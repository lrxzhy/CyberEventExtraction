Minimum Wage
April 04, 2011
If you want to know why the Democrats keep treading water in spite of an unpopular president and the feckless pork-barrel leadership of congressional Republicans, look no further than the minimum wage. In a recent move that was about as surprising as a low- scoring soccer game, Democrats made it clear they will make the minimum wage a central part of their election strategy. They certainly took to the pulpits in recent weeks. A higher minimum wage is terrible economic policy and Americans know it.
