Dead Fish Reported in River
May 19, 2011
Reports of large accumulations of dead fish washing on shore have been received. The area of concern is along the Vast River near Westside and Plainville in Vastopolis. Resident fishermen have also reported the sightings and complain that the fish have ``stopped biting''. While dead fish have been found on shore, they have not been seen in this quantity. One of the fisherman even reported that the smell and feel of the fish was different and wondered out loud, ``Something is wrong here.''
