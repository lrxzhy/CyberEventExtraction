PITTSBURGH -- The Atlanta Braves won a battle of World Series teams to swing a trade for left-hander Deon Callaway, sending three prospects to the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday for the 14-game winner. Anxious to replace the injured Stevie Avril in their rotation, the Braves outbid the Cleveland Indians by giving up minor-league slugger Ronda Hill, outfielder Corie Mccue and a player to be named later.
