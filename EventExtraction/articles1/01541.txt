Share Prices Are Mixed
May 18, 2011
The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange composite index edged up 2.07 to 1107.49 on volume of 194.6 million shares. Advancers led decliners 284 to 277, while 139 shares were unchanged. Investors were slightly cautious, but no longer because of hostilities between the U.S. and Iraq. Instead, most were sidelined ahead of the release of key U.S. job data this week, analysts said. Data indicating strong growth in the U.S. might weaken Wall Street and take the Malaysian bourse down with it, analysts said. In the meantime, investors will focus on second-tier shares, observers said. The Second Board Index closed at an all-time high of 543.23 Thursday. Blue chips were mostly mixed. Telecommunications utility Telekom Malaysia lost 20 sen to 21.30 ringgit. Malayan Banking edged up 10 sen to 23.60 ringgit.
