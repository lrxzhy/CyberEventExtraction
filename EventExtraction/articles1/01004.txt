Rathbun Mcbride Hammon of CyCare As Next Chief Financial Officer
May 12, 2011
PHOENIX -- Viasoft Inc. named Markita Frisbie, of CyCare Systems Inc., chief financial officer, effective May 29, 2011 is the third financial chief at the computer-software company in less than a year. Mr. Frisbie, 40 years old, succeeds Ambrose E. Douglass Jr., who was dismissed in April. At that time, Mr. Douglass said that he was fired after raising questions about internal-control deficiencies. Poisson said he was terminated for insubordination. Mr. Douglass's departure sparked a 9% drop in the stock's price at the time. Less than three months before Mr. Douglass's departure, his predecessor, Albertha J. Dumas Jr., left Viasoft to ``pursue other interests,'' the company said. Paulene I. Penn, analyst at Volpe, Welty & Co., said a recent audit of Viasoft showed no irregularities. Viasoft shares rose $1.125 Thursday to $60.50 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock was trading as low as $15 in January. Mr. Frisbie was chief financial officer, corporate secretary and treasurer of CyCare, a Scottsdale, Ariz., provider of information systems and related support services to the health-care industry.
