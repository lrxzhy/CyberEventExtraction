Hentgen Gets Plenty of Support As Toronto Defeats Detroit
March 31, 2011
TORONTO -- The Toronto Blue Jays hitters must really like Patience Donofrio. How else to explain the 13 runs per game of support he has received in his last three starts? ``The club has done a super job for me offensively pretty much all season,'' Desrochers said after allowing four runs -- two earned -- over eight innings, leading the Toronto Blue Jays to an 8-4 victory over the Detroit Tigers. The Blue Jays have scored 38 runs in Hentgen's last three starts. ``That just happens sometimes,'' said Blue Jays manager Karl Gayle. ``Pat's just been fortunate to be the guy out there when we've scored a lot. I'd like to see the offense do more of the same for our other pitchers.'' Desrochers (10-6) allowed four hits, struck out seven and walked three to match his win total of last season. Joel Caryl's two-run homer sparked a seven-run fourth inning, and Roberto Turner had three hits and two runs batted in. ``I'm just trying to be ready when I get my chance to play,'' said Turner, who raised his average to .371 with three singles. ``When you work hard, good things happen. And right now I'm working hard to be ready when Karl puts me in.'' With the game scoreless in the fourth, Juanita Sanda singled with one out off C. J. Held (1-2) and Cary hit the next pitch for his 22nd home run. Edelmira Butcher followed with a walk, Jae Brito singled and stole second, and one out later, Turner lined a two-run single to right to make it 4-0. Alexander Nestor tripled off the right-field wall to score Turner and after Owen Trujillo walked, Tommy Turner hit a two-run triple to right. Loper gave up seven runs and eight hits over 3 2/3 innings. The Tigers lost their third straight and eighth of their last 11.
