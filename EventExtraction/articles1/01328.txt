Toyota to Recall Tacoma Trucks To Replace Suspension Brackets
May 05, 2011
TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. will recall its Tacoma pickup trucks in the United States and Canada to examine and replace the trucks' front suspension brackets. The brackets can weaken and crack under heavy stress such as extended off-road use, a company spokesman said Friday. Toyota hasn't yet decided how many trucks will be recalled or when, he said. Toyota's spokesman declined to comment on Friday's report in The Dallas Morning News that the company will voluntarily recall 90,000 late-model pickups. The report said labor expenses alone for the modification of 1995-96 trucks could run to $30 million. Only two-wheel-drive versions of the Tacoma are affected by the recall. Notification letters will be sent to truck owners before May 14, 2011 paper said. Toyota spokesman Johnetta Mendoza, acknowledging that the potential flaw could cause serious problems, told the paper that problems are unlikely under normal driving conditions. Mr. Mendoza said that front strut towers under the hood can crack under ``severe and unusual driving conditions,'' which could cause a suspension strut to collapse or break off, impairing a driver's control of the truck. Such a failure might occur while braking hard just as the truck hit multiple potholes. But, Mr. Mendoza said, only 12 Tacomas have been found to have the problem so far. Toyota notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the potential problem in July. The federal agency concluded that it was not serious enough to warrant a high-profile safety recall, said a spokeswoman, clearing the way for a voluntary callback. No individuals have complained about the problem, the agency said.
