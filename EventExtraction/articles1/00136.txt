Shares Prices End Flat
April 04, 2011
The 25-share AEX index closed down 0.21 at 525.41. There was little corporate news to guide trading Tuesday, though Royal Dutch Petroleum was helped by higher earnings from its U.S. affiliate, Shell Oil, whose second-quarter net income rose 15% to $445 million, excluding extraordinary items. Royal Dutch, which accounts for 10% of the AEX index, climbed 1.70 guilders to 253.20. Philips Electronics, which reports its first half earnings Thursday, was among the day's most actively traded stocks. Analysts expect Philips to post first-half earnings of between 1.05 billion and 1.14 billion guilders, down from 1.33 billion guilders a year ago. Philips eased 0.10 guilder to 49.60.
