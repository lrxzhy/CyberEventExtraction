Tell it Like it Is
May 12, 2011
Mom. Apple pie. Diners. Nothing can be more American than a hot cup of plain old coffee (no fancy `Starbucks' flavors, thank you), a plate of steaming flapjacks smothered in real butter and maple syrup, and eggs sunny-side-up. All brought to you by a woman with big hair and comfortable shoes who refers to you, your companions, and everyone else in the room as: ``hon.'' Even Vastopolis can lay claim to a sprinkling of authentic diners. And no, Eddie Trevino and Johnny Rockets don't count. The White Palace comes to mind. So does Jimmie's Grill.
