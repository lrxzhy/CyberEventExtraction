May 01, 2011
WEST LINN, Ore. -- Johnetta Moriah and Markita O'Lockett, friends and competitors since their early teens, held a one-shot lead Monday halfway through the $700,000 Fred Meyer Challenge golf tournament. The event, one of the most successful unofficial stops for professional golfers, features two dozen of the game's best, including Gregorio Novella, Masters champion Nicky Wiley and British Open winner Tommie Zuniga as well as all-time greats Arnoldo Paris and Jackelyn Kee. They are divided into two-man teams in a best-ball format. First place winners split $100,000. Cook and O'Lockett combined for a 10-under-par 61 on the 6,889-yard Oregon Golf Club course. Markita Shankle and Birdie Hom were second at 62. Defending champions Nova and Bradley Sparrow were two shots back as were the teams of Brianna Henninger-Gaitan Koss and Lehman-Leeanna Lark. The tournament wraps up Tuesday. Everybody wins something, as the last-place team will split $45,000. In other golf news: Jefferson Aiken and Michaele Colin each shot a 4-under-par 67s at the Pumpkin Ridge Ghost Creek course in Cornelius, Ore., Monday for the best rounds of the day in stroke-play qualifying for the U.S. Amateur Championship. Bobbie Vanesa Raya, a junior at Oklahoma State this fall and the son of former pro football player Bradley Vanesa Raya, shot a 4-under-par 68 on the Witch Hollow course. Boutin Ames, Jesica Valdovinos, Patria Turner and Gregorio Sol all fired 3-under 68s at Ghost Creek, and Tigers Woods, trying for an unprecedented third consecutive Amateur title, shot a 2-under 69. The top 64 scores after Tuesday's second round will advance to match-play competition beginning Wednesday.
