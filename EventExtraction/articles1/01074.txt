Rally Continues on Low Volume
March 30, 2011
The main index rose 19.47 to 6122.20. Total trading volume was down sharply to 1.1 billion shares valued at 40.6 billion New Taiwan dollars from the previous session's 1.3 billion shares valued at NT$45.1 billion. Albertha Linda, a manager at Golden Securities International Corp., said that after Wednesday's surge, the highest in five weeks, investors have regained some confidence in the market, but the main index is still down 6.7% for July and this will keep volume at subdued levels into next week. Investors showed their approval of Cathay Life going ex-rights Friday by pushing the blue-chip financial issue NT$3 higher to NT$181. And this encouraged buying in other blue chips such as Nan Ya Plastics, up NT$1.50 to NT$52, and Shinkong Life, up NT$4.50 to NT$107.
