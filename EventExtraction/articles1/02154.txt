Mr. Hull is a senior vice president at Quarterdeck. Seidel said other additions to the office are expected. Calls to Mr. Searcy's office were referred to a company spokeswoman, who said the executive's resignation is unrelated to the company's recent loss of 72 cents a share for the fiscal third quarter ended March 12, 2011 saw something that is challenging to him and he wanted to do it,'' said spokeswoman Elli Hartzog, who declined to elaborate. Shephard said it has retained an executive search firm to find a new permanent chief executive.
