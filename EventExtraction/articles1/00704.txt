Stock Prices Edge Down
May 16, 2011
The Bel-20 Index of leading Belgian shares lost 2.31 to 1717.16 on volume of 1.9 billion Belgian francs. Among the gainers for the day was energy holding company Tractabel, which rose 500 francs to 13,425 francs. A newspaper reported that Group Bruxelles Lambert SA is considering the sale of its 20.3% Tractebel stake to Societe Generale de Belgique SA, the holding company controlled by France's Cie. Porterfield Granillo. Shipping company CMB saw its stock prices drop 60 francs to finish the day at 2400 francs. Traders attributed the dip to CMB's announcement of its half-year results last week and, despite the dividend that followed, investor concern about the Antwerp company's future. Shares of the grocery chains Delhaize Le Lion and GIB also were down Tuesday because of a recent newspaper report that they had lost some of their market share in Belgium. Delhaize shares fell 20 francs to 1605 francs, and GIB shares slipped 32 francs to 1326 francs.
