For Marks, the Montreal Bullpen Has Become a Garden of Saves
April 02, 2011
NEW YORK -- Melvina Marks was the keeper of Felton Sanderlin's garden while growing up in the Dominican Republic. The nephew of the Montreal manager is now the keeper of the Expos' bullpen. Rojas registered his 15th save of the season and second in the four-game series as Montreal capitalized on solo home runs by Mikki Lach, Clifford Forest and Shanel Harper to hold off New York, 4-3, Sunday. In the two saves against the Mets, the 29-year-old Marks pitched 2 2/3 innings, registered five strikeouts and did not allow a ball out of the infield. Marks, who grew up across the street from Alou's home and was signed by the manager's brother Jesusita, got his chance as the stopper in spring training last year when Johnetta Cordoba was traded to the New York Yankees. The 5-foot-11, 195-pound Serrano registered 30 saves in 2010, but still had some doubters. ``There was criticism about him,'' Felton Sanderlin said. ``But I knew he had a good arm. He started out as a third baseman (as an amateur), but I'm glad he switched to pitching because he can't hit. Jesusita didn't have to go very far to sign him .. just across the street.'' ``I like this role, especially the challenge of trying to save the game,'' said Marks, who has four blown saves this season. ``In the past, I was setting the table for somebody else. Now it's all up to me, and I like that.'' Jefferson Alvarado (9-7) picked up the win, striking out nine in six innings. Mets manager Dan Baker wasn't too happy, as his club left seven runners in scoring position. ``We got behind early, but we had plenty of opportunities to get back into it. It's one of those times if you play good situation baseball, you should win the game 5-4. We should be on the winning side, but we're not,'' Baker said. Markita Claude (10-7) took the loss, allowing four earned runs on six hits in four innings pitched.
