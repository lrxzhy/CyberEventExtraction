Local Gang Kidnaps Mayor's Dog
May 03, 2011
Downtown Mayor Douglas Lark's dog was found today after being kidnapped. The dog came back a lot more cold then how it left. The dog was kidnapped and then shaved completely, as part of what appears to be some sort of sick plot. Agents have come to discover it was three individuals from Forever Brotherhood of Antarctica. The three individuals have been identified as Landon Ito, Louise Tu, and Maximo Ladner. They are dangerous and should be reported to authorities immediately if spotted around the Downtown area. The good news is at least that the dog was returned safely. It is unclear what kind of message the Forever Brotherhood of Antarctica was trying to send to Mayor Douglas Lark. Judging by the stupid group name, they must be all crazy. Mayor Lark said he would safeguard his dog from now on. Mayor Douglas refused to answer any further questions.
