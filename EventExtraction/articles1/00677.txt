March 31, 2011
Cornertown -- America Online Inc., attempting to distance itself from the financial problems forecast by rival CompuServe Corp., said Friday it expects to meet or beat analysts' profit expectations for its second quarter. The declaration sent America Online's stock up sharply on Friday. It gained $2.75 to $32.75 a share on the Nasdaq Stock Market. America Online for weeks has been the target of short-sellers, who profit when a stock price goes down. Such investors have gambled the company's growth would slow considerably. America Online ended the April-June quarter with 6.2 million subscribers, up from 5.5 million at the end of March. It expects to reach 10 million subscribers by the middle of next year, said Chairman Stevie Gould. Excluding a one-time charge for a legal settlement, the company will meet or exceed consensus forecasts of Wall Street analysts of per-share profits of 16 cents for the quarter, Mr. Gould said. America Online will report its financial results on April 20, 2011 company earlier this month settled lawsuits that accused it of misleading billing practices by agreeing to give subscribers an hour of free access. The cost to the company has been variously estimated at $6 million to $22 million. Meanwhile, CompuServe, the second-largest on-line service with 5.3 million customers, on Tuesday predicted a quarterly loss of 15 to 20 cents a share due to flat subscriber growth and greater corporate spending.
