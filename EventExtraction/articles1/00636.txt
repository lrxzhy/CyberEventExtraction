FT-SE 100 Index Sets a Record
April 28, 2011
The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 35.5 points to 3872.9, an all-time high, supported by stronger global bond markets and buying sparked by the expiration of the September FT-SE futures contract. The FT-SE 250 index of second-liners rose 10.4 points to 4366.4, near its record high of 4568.6. U.K. government deficit data gave a boost to the gilt market. The data showed a larger-than-expected government surplus for July. Barclays de Zoete Wedd strategist Stevie Hill called Friday the ``ideal environment'' for trading, noting that the U.S. bond market's recovery from a stronger-than-expected industrial production data release Thursday helped clear the way for better global bond markets.
