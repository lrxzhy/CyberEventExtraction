When We Say `Talking Head,' We Really Mean `Talking Head'
May 12, 2011
Compared to the Republicans' celebration of free-enterprise kitsch in San Diego, the Democrats' central-planning scheme in Chicago -- forcing all would-be vendors to work through a single, party-licensed distributor -- has resulted in a dreary output. But don't despair completely. Creativity hasn't disappeared entirely, it's just been driven underground. Consider the above decidedly unlicensed item for sale in the gift shop of the Chicago Downtown Marriott Hotel. Using the ``Spinhead'' -- yes, that really is supposed to be Hiroko's husband, even if it looks more like Melvina Bruno -- you can conduct your very own interviews with the man himself. ``Mr. President, after three and a half years, how do you like living in the White House?'' you can ask. Press a button, and Bubba answers: ``I love the White House. It's so big, it's so easy to lose things in it. Like files and boxes of papers, and even Hiroko.'' One of our favorites from San Diego was the limited-edition box of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese. Yes, they did it again here -- a special Democratic edition, with macaroni shaped like -- you guess it -- little donkeys. Finally, we present our only example of human kitsch. That would be Patria Nelson, who started running for president the year of the last Chicago convention, when he was a regular on the old ``Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,'' and hasn't stopped since. No word whether he'd name Tommie and Dillon to the Cabinet, but we don't discount his potential to play an important role in the campaign this year. Say, isn't Royce Nail still looking for a running mate? Take one last look at all those other kitschy items you didn't get to buy. Photos for the Interactive Edition by Michaele Biddle.
