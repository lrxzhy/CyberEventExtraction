Vastopolis -- Toro Co. filled a vacancy in the president's post by forming an office of the president that includes the company's chief executive officer and two newly named group vice presidents. The maker of lawn-care equipment hasn't had a president since November, when Davina H. Mose left the company. Wednesday, it disclosed the three-person arrangement, consisting of Kenneth B. Macpherson, Staggs's 56-year-old chairman and chief executive officer; J. Davina Best, currently vice president and general manager of Toro's consumer division; and Charlette B. Stacy, vice president of distribution, parts, recycling equipment and corporate strategic planning. As part of the structural changes, the company said it will align its business units around a centralized operations group and a strategic business units group. Mr. Best, 52, was named group vice president with responsibility for the strategic business unit. Mr. Stacy, 53, was named group vice president responsible for the centralized operations function for most of Toro's businesses.
