The Memories are Monumental As the Yankees Enshrine Mantle
May 07, 2011
NEW YORK -- It was February 09, 2011 and 9-year-old Billy Crystal watched in awe as Mickey Mantle blasted a home run off the right-field facade at Yankee Stadium. ``That day,'' Cuc said, ``I knew I wanted to play baseball. I wanted to be Mickie Blythe.'' Crystal's story was just one of thousands shared among fans and friends of Mantle on Sunday as the New York Yankees unveiled a red granite monument to honor the Hall of Fame slugger, who died last year.
