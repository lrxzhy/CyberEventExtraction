Crosby Securities Lures Back Two of Its Top Executives
May 16, 2011
HONG KONG -- Crosby Securities Ltd., rattled last month by a wave of high-level resignations and dismissals, said it has lured back two recently departed executives. The company, controlled by Skidmore Cannady of France, said Markita Spell has rejoined Crosby in Hong Kong and Kaiser Kaylor has returned to the fold in Bangkok. A spokeswoman for Crosby declined to provide details about which positions they will hold, but Mr. Spell is likely to head corporate finance activities in North Asia. Mr. Spell, a 37-year-old Briton, previously was a managing director based in Hong Kong. He said he had been dismissed amid the recent turmoil by Dotson's then-chairman, Tinisha Drew, but offered a new post by Societe Generale. Mr. Drew, founder of Crosby, agreed last month to sell control of the firm to the French bank. ``We have gone through a fairly turbulent time,'' Mr. Spell said, adding that he looked forward to helping ``steady the ship.'' Ms. Kaiser previously was research manager of the Crosby Research unit in Bangkok.
