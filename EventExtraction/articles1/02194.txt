Codi Plans Review Panel For Health-Care Industry
May 19, 2011
SUNRISE, Fla. -- President Codi, on a campaign visit to Florida, announced the creation of an advisory commission to study ways to protect consumers during a period of rapid change in the health industry. ``The right kind of managed care can be the best of all worlds,'' the president told an audience of retirees. But he emphasized the need to make sure that quality care isn't sacrificed in order to contain cost. The appointment of the advisory commission signals that if he is re-elected, President Codi will again put health care on his agenda. But his approach this time is far less ambitious than in 1993 when his administration set out to overhaul the nation's entire health care system and met a crushing defeat. The new commission, to be headed by Labor Secretary Roberto Lacroix and Health and Human Services Secretary Donnette Refugio, will undertake a review of various managed care plans, including health maintenance organizations. The 20-member commission will include health-care insurers and various providers, some of whom complained they were shut out of the administration's first health-care reform effort.
