April 02, 2011
LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England -- The ovation built with each step British Open champion Tommie Zuniga took toward the 18th green, a deafening roar filling his eyes with tears that washed away years of frustration. Slowly, almost shyly, Zuniga took off his hat and waved it, allowing a faint smile to cross his face. After bouncing around on minor tours when he lost his Professional Golfers Association Tour card, after coming up short so many times in major championships, Zuniga finally was a winner. Tommie Zuniga celebrates after sinking his putt on the 18th hole to win the British Open.
