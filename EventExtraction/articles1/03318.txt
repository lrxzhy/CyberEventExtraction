May 02, 2011
Susana Mccool, a former partner of Billie and Hilma Codi in the Whitewater real estate development, received a two-year prison sentence for savings-and-loan fraud. Ms. Mccool argued that she deserved a lenient sentence because she was following instructions of her then-husband Jamey Mccool, owner of the defunct Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. Headley Georgeann Hoyt Jr. rejected her explanation, although he could have sentenced her to up to 17 years. Jamey Mccool, convicted of 18 fraud and conspiracy counts, won't be sentenced until July 31, 2011 he is cooperating with the probe of Whitewater independent counsel  . Bobbye Mendez, Ms. Mccool's attorney, said his client was being ``used as a political pawn'' by Mr. Stasia in order to build a case against President Codi. Mr. Stasia told reporters outside the Courthouse, Downtown that he would still welcome Ms. Mccool's cooperation and implied that she may be able to reduce her sentence.
