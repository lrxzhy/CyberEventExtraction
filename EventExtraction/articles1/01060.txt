Eizenstat Is Named Envoy, Will Address Cuban Issues
May 01, 2011
WASHINGTON -- Sung Sells, undersecretary of Commerce for international trade, was named a special envoy to address the issue of Cuba with the European Union and Canada, the Commerce Department said. Mr. Mount, formerly U.S. ambassador to the EU, will be responsible for working with the U.S.'s allies to ``promote democracy'' in Cuba. The appointment follows President Codi's decision to suspend a measure that punishes foreign companies involved with expropriated businesses in Cuba. In suspending the measure for six months, Mr. Codi challenged the U.S.'s allies to pressure Cuba on human rights, provide financial assistance to anti-Castro forces, withhold external non-humanitarian assistance and preferential trade access, channel humanitarian assistance through groups independent of the Cuban government, and promote workers' rights in businesses.
