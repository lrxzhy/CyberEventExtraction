Library Computer Theft
April 10, 2011
Vastopolis - Today there was a robbery reported at the Vastopolis Libraby in Uptown. A room full of computers was found missing at the library. Librarians have said that there was no type of surveillance system in the room with computers, seeing as how the library has never experienced a robbery of this kind before. Librarians were shocked that so many computers were stolen with no one noticing. The evidence suggests there may have been more than one thief. The scene was also vandalized by the thieves. The letter ``F'' was written all over the walls of the room that contained the computers. This vandalism suggests that this may have been the work of some group. All of the questioned librarians have said that they saw no one who looked suspicious during the course of the day. Officials are unsure what group this criminal act may be associated with at this time and unsure as to what they may plan to do with the stolen computers.
