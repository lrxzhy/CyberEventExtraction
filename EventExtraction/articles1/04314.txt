Trial Proceeds for Dr. Margarita Verdin
May 09, 2011
Vastopolis Clerk of Court Hanson McKee reports that the scheduled trial for Dr. Margarita Verdin is ``on''.The trial for the alleged activist for the right-to-die movement will occur on May 16. No other comment was offered except to say that the trial judge, Colby Mcelrath, felt he could recover rapidly after a light touch of the flu, which affected him rather unexpectedly. The Clerk seemed proud with his assertion that ``justice must be as swift as it is just''.
