VASTOPOLIS -- Toray Industries Inc., a leading Japanese synthetic-fiber maker, said it plans to build a carbon-fiber manufacturing plant in Vastopolis, U.S. to meet growing demand for the products. A spokesman for Toray said the Japanese company expects to put the plant into operation in 2014 at the earliest, with an initial production capacity of about 1,800 metric tons a year. But he noted that the amount of a total investment for the project are still to be worked out. Marr Schoenfeld Neil, a major economic daily, said that if realized, the plant would be the largest carbon-fiber manufacturing facility in the U.S.
