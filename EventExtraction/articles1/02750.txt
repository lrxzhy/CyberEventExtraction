Investors Fear Rising U.S. Rates
May 16, 2011
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index ended the day down 28.6 at 3855.8 on volume of about 601.7 million shares. The benchmark September futures contract ended the trading day at 3871, compared with Monday's close at 3894. The FT-SE 250 index of midcapitalization stocks fell 28.6 to 4385.4. Fears of rising U.S. interest rates were calmed partially by a report from the U.S. National Association of Purchasing Management that showed a narrower than forecast rise in August. Utilities were among the most actively traded issues Tuesday. PowerGen fell 8 to 496, while National Power gave up 9 at 393. Electricity distributors also came under some selling pressure, with Yorkshire Electric down 7 to 747.5 and Northern Electric off 5 to 523.5. Water issues also were hard hit. Anglian Water fell 5 to 576.5 and Hollifield dropped 6 to 721.5.
