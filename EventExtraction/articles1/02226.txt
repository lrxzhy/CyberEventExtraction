Manulife Regent Will Launch Two No-Load Funds in October
May 11, 2011
HONG KONG -- Fund-management company Manulife Regent Investment Asia Ltd., a joint venture between Hong Kong-based Regent Fund Management Ltd. and Canadian insurer Manulife International Ltd., will launch two no-load mutual funds in October, said Denny Gaskins, Segal Cardoso's manager of investor services. One fund will track the Hong Kong stock market's Hang Seng Index, and the other will focus on Eastern European stocks. The products will become part of Manulife Regent's current range of eight no-load equity funds and one no-load currency fund. While the two new funds won't levy a front-end load, there will be a redemption fee for investors who withdraw their money within the first two years of their investment, Mr. Gaskins said. Manulife Regent will charge annual management fees of less than 1% for the Hong Kong index-tracker fund and 1.5% for the Eastern European equity fund. The funds will be domiciled in Luxembourg and managed from Manulife Regent's offices in London. Mr. Gaskins said his company plans to launch more mutual funds, including bond funds, next year.
