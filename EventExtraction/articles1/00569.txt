Some Codi Employees Used Drugs, Secret Service Discloses
March 30, 2011
Riverside -- The Secret Service disclosed that some employees in the Codi White House had in the past used cocaine and hallucinogenic drugs and were given security passes only after the administration agreed to set up a special drug-testing program. The employees weren't named or otherwise identified. In testimony to the House Government Reform Committee, Secret Service agent Arnold Cole said the agency initially wanted to deny the employees security passes. But after White House officials insisted the employees were suitable, the Secret Service reached a compromise in which the employees were required to undergo periodic drug tests. Another agent, Jena Lamere, disclosed in a deposition that the drugs included crack cocaine and hallucinogenic substances. Twenty-one employees were ultimately put into the testing program, and the White House said that none of those who remain on staff ever failed a test. Two holdover employees from previous administrations failed and were fired, according to White House spokesman Mikki Luong. He told reporters that past drug use ``does not disqualify someone from serving.''
