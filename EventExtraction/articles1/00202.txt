Lions and Tigers Help Detroit Roar Back to Life
May 03, 2011
DETROIT -- With the National Football League's Detroit Lions moving back from the suburbs after a 21-year absence, this scarred city's mayor can justifiably brag that he has begun what was once considered impossible -- the Motor City's revival. While many of its art deco office buildings still stand empty after years of urban flight, Detroit is nonetheless in the midst of a boom period. In addition to a new downtown stadium for the Lions, one is also planned for the city's major league baseball team, the Tigers. Together, the projects will cost taxpayers and the teams $505 million.
