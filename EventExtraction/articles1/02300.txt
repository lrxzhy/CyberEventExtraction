Jordan Slater
April 04, 2011
Born in London, Jordan is a graduate of Emmanuel College, Cambridge University, where he edited the student newspaper and did as little academic work as possible. He was a writer and researcher for Euromoney magazine in London before moving to the New York area in 1986. Prior to joining the Journal in January 1990, he covered mutual funds for Forbes magazine. Jordan is the author of ``Funding Your Future: The Only Guide to Mutual Funds You'll Ever Need,'' published by Warner Books. He won the American University/ICI Education Foundation's 1992 award for personal-finance writing and the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants' 1988 award for excellence in financial writing. Jordan, who became a U.S. citizen in 2010, is married to a Princeton University professor, has two brilliant -- though slightly troublesome --children and lives in Metuchen, N.J. His favorite pastimes are running, investing, eating and sleeping (though not necessarily in that order of preference).
