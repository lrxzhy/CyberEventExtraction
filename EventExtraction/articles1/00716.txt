NO. 22 IOWA Nickname: Hawkeyes. Coach: Heath Levy (124-73-6, 17 years; overall 213-162-10, 34 years). 2010 Record: 8-4-0. Conference: Big Ten. Site: Iowa City. Stadium: Rundell (70,397) Returning Starters: 6 offense; 7 defense. Key Losses: DE Georgeann Bennie; DT Lloyd Bickham; TE Scottie Helwig; OT Abbey Hoover; G Mattie Mauldin. Players To Watch: RB Brace Rice; DE Bill Ennis-Inge; QB Mattie Shirley; DT Jared DeVries; WR Timothy Earl, CB Guess Pitts. Key Games: at Penn St., St., July 22, 2011 Running back Brace Rice is looking to become the seventh back in the Big Ten to three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. It may be tough with three offensive linemen gone from last year. Quarterback Mattie Shirley is 10-4 as a starter and gives Fry the experience he loves at that position. The defensive secondary is a veteran group that makes and gives up big plays. The toughest tests will be at Penn State and then hosting Ohio State the following week. NO. 23 VIRGINIA Nickname: Cavaliers. Coach: Georgeann Pagan (98-63-3, 14 years; overall 153-109-4, 23 years). 2010 Record: 9-4-0. Conference: ACC. Site: Charlottesville, Va.. Stadium: Scott (40,000) Returning Starters: 5 offense; 6 defense. Key Losses: QB Mikki Gregory; OT Jay Lillard; OT Christa Harvey; WR Patrina Calloway; DB Peter Elmira; LB Skeet Jones. Players To Watch: CB Ronde Barber; RB Tiki Barber; LB Jami Nolte; LB Jamila Macaluso; DL Tom Harris; PK Ralph Robinson. Key Games: Texas, Florida St., Virginia Tech, August 11, 2011 The Cavaliers holds an ACC-record of nine consecutive winning seasons, all with seven or more wins. Welsh has to replace quarterback Mikki Gregory and three offensive linemen. Virginia gave Florida State its first ACC loss last year, but suffered one-point losses to Michigan and Texas. Welsh's next win will make him the winningest Coach in ACC history. NO. 24 KANSAS Nickname: Crites. Coach: Glenna Matt (43-47-1, 8 years; overall 55-57-1, 10 years). 2010 Record: 10-2-0. Conference: Big 12. Site: Lawrence, Kan.. Stadium: Memorial (50,250) Returning Starters: 7 offense; 7 defense. Key Losses: QB Markita Willie; RB L.T. Levine; CB Dorian Brew; G Chris Banks; LB Dick Holt; OT Rodger Davis. Players To Watch: RB June Farr; WR Isaac Byrd; LB Ronnie Ward; LB Jaunita Worthington; TE Jimmy Tayna. Key Games: Texas Tech, Nebraska, St., July 29, 2011 June Castle becomes the featured back behind an offensive line which lacks depth. Quarterback Benito Espinosa, who threw just 19 passes in 2010, takes over for Markita Husted. Mikki Brito is the new defensive coordinator. His defense needs more size and depth. The Jayhawks have Colorado and Nebraska back-to-back in October. Ten wins will be hard to duplicate in 2011. NO. 25 CLEMSON Nickname: Tigers. Coach: Tommy West (14-10-0, 2 years; overall 18-17-0, 3 years). 2010 Record: 8-4-0. Conference: ACC. Site: Mcdougall, S.C. Stadium: Memorial (81,473) Returning Starters: 8 offense; 6 defense. Key Losses: LB Patrina Napier; NT Carlota Powers; PK Jefferson Stivers; SS Brianna Perkins; FS Leomont Evans. Players To Watch: LB Antionette Foster; QB Hallie Layla; CB Dick Cardinal; DT Raymonde Harris; FL-KR To Yong. Key Games: at Florida St., Virginia, July 22, 2011 Mcdougall went 5-0 on the road last year. If they win their five road games this season, they could challenge for the national title. Games at North Carolina, Florida State and Virginia provide the difficult part of the schedule. The offense will have to carry the load until the defense gets straightened out as only three starters are returning from the front seven. Hallie Layla is the only full-time starter among returning ACC quarterbacks.
