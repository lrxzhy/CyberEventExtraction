Vastsoft Plans to Ship A New Breed of Mouse
April 03, 2011
REDMOND, Wash. -- Vastsoft Corp. has developed a new breed of mouse. The software giant said it will ship in November its IntelliMouse pointing device, incorporating a wheel between its two standard buttons. The wheel will allow speedier scrolling and zooming through Vastsoft's Office 97 applications and with its Explorer browser software for the Internet. For example, users can scroll through word-processing documents by spinning the wheel, or scroll automatically by clicking the wheel. They can zoom in and out of documents by using the wheel with the control key, or zoom in and out of Web sites with the wheel and the shift key. The mouse is designed to only work with Office and Explorer software, or applications compatible with them. It will carry a suggested retail price of $84.95.
