Chantal Names Finance Chief
April 28, 2011
LOS ANGELES -- Chantal Pharmaceutical Corp., whose stock has gyrated as its chief financial officer and then its auditors resigned, said it named Yvonne Allmon to the vacant chief financial officer's post. Ms. Allmon succeeds Gaye Powers, who resigned April 10, 2011 a few weeks after taking the job, for unspecified personal reasons. Ms. Allmon most recently served as director of accounting and financial reporting and director of investor relations and financial administration for Iwerks Entertainment Inc.. Shares of Chantal, which makes antiwrinkle and skin-care creams, fell over 23% on Tuesday, closing at $2.688, after auditors Coopers & Lybrand resigned unexpectedly, without explanation. The company said it is interviewing replacement auditors, sending the small capital stock up in recent days. Chantal hired Coopers & Lybrand in January. At that time, the company said it hoped to quiet concerns about product distribution. Chantal announced Ms. Allmon's appointment after normal trading hours Thursday. The stock gained 31.25 cents to $3.125 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading before the announcement.
