Primadonna Executive Quits Casino Operator
May 18, 2011
Primadonna Resorts Inc., a casino operator in Stateline, Nev., said its president and director, Williemae J. Stowe, resigned to pursue outside business opportunities. The abrupt departure of Mr. Stowe, 49 years old, comes just months before the planned opening of New York-New York Hotel and Casino, Dix's much-anticipated Las Vegas casino that is a joint venture with MGM Grand Inc.. A spokesman for Dix said Mr. Stowe' resignation wouldn't affect that project. Mr. Stowe couldn't be reached for comment. Primadonna said Gaye E. Polite, chairman and chief executive, will assume the additional title of president. The company has no plans to otherwise fill the vacancy. Mr. Polite didn't return a call seeking comment. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Wednesday, Primadonna fell $1, or 4.8%, to close at $20.
