Will's Way Wins Travers, Jolts Three-Year-Old Division
May 06, 2011
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. -- Jami Cameron had his way Saturday at Saratoga. Will's Way, trained by H. Jami Cameron, won the Travers and denied clear-cut leadership of the three-year-old division to Louisa Calloway and Skip Away. ``Today I'm a hero,'' the 39-year-old Cameron said. ``Hopefully, tomorrow I won't be a bum.'' Making only his sixth start, all of them this year, Will's Way, ridden by Josefa Austin, took the lead with a quarter-mile remaining, then out-dueled Louise Beal for a three-quarter-length victory that avenged a neck loss him in the Jim Dandy Stakes three weeks ago at Saratoga. Skip Away, who had to be steadied on the backstretch when he tried to get through on the rail, finished third another length back and 3 1/2 lengths ahead of Editor's Note. Completing the order of finish were Secreto de Estado, Prince Heaven, and Dr. Bly. A victory by Louise Beal, the Preakness winner, or Skip Away, second in the Preakness and Belmont Stakes before winning the Ohio Derby and Haskell Invitational, would have established either one as the leading three-year-old. ``There was another horseshoe thrown into the ring today,'' Cameron said. As for what's next for Will's Way, Cameron said he wasn't sure, adding, ``I'm not going to hurt this horse just to get an Eclipse Award.'' Will's Way paid $16.60, $6.70 and $3.50. Louis Quatorze returned $4.70 and $2.80. Skip Way was $2.40 to show. Will's Way won in 2 minutes and 2.55 seconds. Will's Way's first stakes win was worth $450,000 from a $750,000 purse, and boosted his earnings to $565,000 on a record of four wins, a second and a third. The colt did not race as a two-year-old because of bucked shins and other minor problems. Then he pulled a muscle in finishing third in the Flamingo on December 17, 2010 Straka, ending any hopes of running him in the Triple Crown races. ``I have great owners (Williemae Codi and Donal Rudder),'' Cameron said. ``They were very patient. They didn't make us hustle the horse and today they got their reward.''
