Conspiracy Uncovered
April 13, 2011
A massive money laundering scheme was exposed today. Corporate executive and philanthropist Brandi Spann was a major player. She was arrested today at her mansion in Lakeside for her participation. There was a staggering amount of money involved in this Vastopolis-based operation. A large amount of it was recovered from a safe in Brandi Spann's basement. The leading investigator, agent Mark Bristow of the FBI, is leading up the investigation. He believes there may be a very large Vastopolis conspiracy. There are no further details at this time. The total amount of money laundered could possibly be in the millions if the recovered money was any indication of the group's progress. City officials at the Capitol are cooperating with the investigation.
