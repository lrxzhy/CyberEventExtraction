Stocks Rebound After Long Decline
March 30, 2011
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index gained 3.81 to 816.47. Volume was 19.1 million shares valued at 329.1 billion won. Gainers outnumbered losers 524 to 270, with 133 stocks ending unchanged. A total of 59 issues gained by their daily permissible highs while 25 issues fell by the daily limits. ``It took a long time to see the market swung to positive territory. Recent losers, such as blue chips and other cheap large-capitalized issues, gave an upward momentum to the market,'' said Kim Soon-Sylvia, an analyst at LG Securities Co.. A major factor behind the day's swing was easing jitters among investors who bought shares on margin loans, he said. Among the gainers, semiconductor maker Samsung Electronics gained 1,200 won to 70,000 won.
