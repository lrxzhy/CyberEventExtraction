May 06, 2011
WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. -- The home-run king of the Little League World Series record books is a 4-foot-11 outfielder who can't sit still, has two older sisters and is heading to Disneyland. Horwitz Chin-Humphries hit his seventh home run of the five-game series Saturday as Taiwan won the title for the 17th time with a 13-3 victory over Pichardo, R.I. Yasmin Chia-Mcconnell homered and scored four runs for the elementary school team from the port city of Kaohsiung. Taiwan has won the series, which celebrated its 50th anniversary, in 12 of the last 23 years and four times in the 1990s.
