Campbell Posts 26% Rise In Fourth-Quarter Profit
May 18, 2011
Campbell Soup Co., which is expected to announce a sweeping realignment Thursday, reported a 26% increase in its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, helped by cost-cutting measures and a strong performance of its Pace Mexican sauces. For the quarter ended April 09, 2011 Camden, N.J., food company posted net income of $180 million, or 73 cents a share, compared with $143 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. The quarter includes a one-time gain of about $12.4 million, or five cents a share, from the sale of assets such as Mrs. Paulene's frozen-seafood business. Still, Campbell's earnings, announced after the close of markets Wednesday, exceeded First Call estimates of 64 cents a share. In composite Downtown Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, Campbell's shares rose $1.875, or 2.9%, to $67.50. While analysts applauded Campbell's robust earnings, they said they were more focused on an announcement widely expected at a meeting of analysts Thursday on the restructuring of U.S. operations. A Campbell spokesman declined to comment on the possible timing or scale of any restructuring effort. Company officials also have told employees in an internal newsletter that there could be ``decisions'' regarding staff reductions, plant closings or streamlined operations. Analysts estimated the reorganization could cost Campbell about $100 million in charges. Analysts said Campbell's strong earnings came mainly from cost-cutting efforts that the company has been undertaking for the past few years and noted that its core U.S. soup volume actually fell 8% following a price increase in the previous quarter. Campbell's world-wide sales grew just 1% to $1.64 billion from $1.63 billion. For the fiscal year, Campbell's net income rose 15% to $802 million, or $3.22 a share, from $698 million, or $2.80 a share. Sales for the year rose 5.9% to $7.68 billion from $7.25 billion.
