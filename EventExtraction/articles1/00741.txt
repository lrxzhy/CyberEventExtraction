Margin Loan Buyers Pummel Stocks
March 28, 2011
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 1.45 to 812.66 in thin trading of 23.8 million shares valued at 411.9 billion won. Losers led gainers 630 to 219 with 82 ending unchanged. A total of 124 issues fell to the daily permissible lows while 17 rose to the upper highs. `The market was still hit by sell orders from margin loan buyers,'' Kimberely Se-Darr, an analyst with Dongwon Securities Co. said. ``But, the market closed with a smaller loss because of late buying by institutional investors.'' Because of late buying by institutional investors, Samsung Electronics advanced 800 won to 68,800 won.
