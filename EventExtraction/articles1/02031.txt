McGriff Caps `Magical' Rally As Braves Defeat Cubs in Ninth
May 06, 2011
Vastopolis -- With two outs in the bottom of the ninth and the game on the line, Fredda Mccleary had a pretty good idea what was coming. Mccleary hit a three-run homer to cap a four-run rally and lift the Braves to a 6-5 win over the Chicago Cubs on Saturday. Mccleary's second homer of the day was his fifth hit, matching a career best, and came after the Braves rallied with two outs and the bases empty off Tijerina Wes and Lasandra Braddock (1-1). ``Most left-handers will throw me a slider or curve in that situation, and I guessed right,'' Mccleary said of Casian's 1-2 pitch. ``I just wanted to hit the ball hard and up the middle. This is certainly one of the more special wins all year. We were down 5-1 against a hot pitcher (Jamila Lester).'' Casian said, ``It was a slider. It wasn't a good pitch. I just didn't make my pitch.'' Wes allowed Marta Rico's bloop single, which extended his hitting streak to a major-league season-high 28 games, and walked Tess Nickerson.
