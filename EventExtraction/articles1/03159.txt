Disney to Reopen Theater With `King Davida' Concert
May 02, 2011
Vastopolis -- Walt Disney Co. said a concert version of a new musical called ``King David'' will be the first event at the newly renovated New Disney theater on Broadway. Disney, which had success with ``Beauty and the Beast,'' its first Broadway show, leased the historic New Show in 2009. It agreed to spend about $30 million to restore and reopen the theater, which was built in 1903. ``King Davida,'' with music by Albert Bruner and lyrics by Timmy Robertson, will play for five performances beginning January 30, 2011 Disney said the concert may lead to a full-scale Broadway musical. The concert is based on the story of the shepherd boy who was chosen to be king of Israel. Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., noted that three of Mr. Robertson's earlier works, ``Chess,'' ``Evita'' and ``Jesusa Carper Orndorff,'' began as concerts. Mr. Robertson wrote the lyrics for Disney's movie ``The Lion King.'' Mr. Bruner is the composer of such Disney animated blockbusters as ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``Lavin.'' ``King David'' will be directed by Miki Berger, the director of ``Crazy for You'' and ``Big.''
