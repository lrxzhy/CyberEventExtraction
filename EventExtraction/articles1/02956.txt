Stocks Fall on Wall Street Loss
March 28, 2011
The blue chip FT-SE 100 share index shed 66.0 points to close at 3632.3 on provisional volume of 682.5 million shares. At the market's close, the benchmark September future was trading at 3,625.0, compared with Monday's close of 3,692.0. The FT-SE 250 index of second-liners spiraled down 90.6 points to end the day at 4201.0 points. London began the session in negative territory, as the market struggled to trade above the technical support level of 3650 points. But it couldn't manage to go higher than 3653.0 points early in trading, a loss of 45.3 points from Monday's close. After a good start, based largely on a number of positive second-quarter results, the Dow Jones Industrial Average late tumbled as Wall Street trading continued into the early afternoon.
