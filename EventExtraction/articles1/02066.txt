Bell Atlantic Chooses Lucent As Supplier of Network Gear
March 29, 2011
VASTOPOLIS -- Bell Atlantic Corp. said it selected Lucent Technologies Inc. as a supplier of gear for its new full-service network in a deal that could be worth ``several hundred million'' to Lucent over the next 6 years. Lucent, VastComm Network Corp.'s equipment arm that is due to be spun off in September, will supply gear that will permit the Vastopolis-based Baby Bell to offer voice, data and video services over its telephone lines. BroadBand Technologies Inc. of Durham, N.C., will work with Lucent, providing a variety of broadband components to the Bell, which provides local phone services throughout the mid-Atlantic. Bell Atlantic said it plans to begin offering video services over its lines by the third quarter of 2012, though it plans to offer wireless cable fare in some markets long before then. Bell Atlantic, which is in the process of acquiring a neighboring Bell, Nynex Corp., said it expects to offer other interactive services beginning in late 2012 or early 2013. Separately, Lucent and Bay Networks Inc. set plans to cross-license a number of patents and technologies, with an eye on developing products for business markets. As part of this agreement, Bay Networks will license its data-routing and network-management source code; in return, Lucent expects to license its real-time switching and voice multimedia technology. The agreement builds on the existing reseller relationship the two companies established in June 2010, under which Lucent resells, services and supports Bay Networks products.
