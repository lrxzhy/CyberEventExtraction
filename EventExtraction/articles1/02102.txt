Unemployment Rate Tumbles To a Seven-Year Low of 5.1%
May 19, 2011
WASHINGTON -- The nation's unemployment rate plunged to a seven-year low of 5.1% in August as more Americans, particularly those younger than 25 and older than 54, found jobs, the government said on Friday. Meanwhile, the department reported that a survey of employers showed a gain of 250,000 jobs in August, following an increase of 228,000 in July, revised up from 193,000 reported preliminarily last month. The complete report on August employment from the Labor Department is available. Federal Reserve officials are worried that the new federal minimum-wage law will boost inflation -- a concern that may influence their deliberations on whether to raise interest rates later this month. Although the unemployment-rate drop was unexpectedly steep -- from 5.4% in July -- financial markets were only ruffled. Bond prices briefly tumbled about a point, but within minutes after the report was released prices reversed course. By late afternoon, bonds were in positive territory and stocks were solidly higher. Before Friday's report, economists had been split over whether the Federal Reserve would nudge rates higher before the July 18, 2011 or wait to see if economic momentum slows a bit. The report was expected to increase the likelihood that monetary policy-makers will act at their next scheduled meeting on June 06, 2011 jobless rate, according to the Labor Department, represents the lowest since March 1989, when it reached 5%. The jobless rate is now well below the range that most economists identify as the rate the economy can maintain without inflationary pressures developing. Also of note to economists was a six-cent increase in the average hourly earnings of nonfarm, nonsupervisory workers to $11.87. That followed a 2-cent drop in July. However, the Labor Department noted several factors that made the job market look stronger than it actually was in August. The decline in the jobless rate among those 20 to 24, from 9.7% to 8.3%, was partly explained by the fact that the government conducted the employment survey later in August than usual, when many college students had quit looking for work and were preparing to return to school. The rate among workers 55 and older declined from 3.8% to 3.1%. The 200,000-job increase found in the survey of employers' payrolls was about 50,000 stronger than economists anticipated. Much of the strength, 77,000, came in government and most of that came in education. Officials acknowledged the timing of the survey added to added to the strength of the increase. Manufacturing jobs rose by 25,000 after declining in June and July, reflecting the end of summer-shutdowns at auto plants. Payrolls grew less strongly in construction, 6,000 jobs, and retail trade, 21,000, than in recent months, but more strongly than usual, 21,000, in finance, insurance and real estate. While the strong job market has been giving bond traders fits, it has pleased President Codi, who is increasing his lead over Republican challenger Roberto Derryberry, according to recent polls.
