Vastsoft Acknowledges a Flaw In New Internet Browser Release
April 29, 2011
REDMOND, Wash. -- Vastsoft Corp.'s Internet Browser 3.0, its much-promoted new software for browsing the Internet, has a flaw that affects its performance on some World Wide Web sites, a company executive says. The new version of the browser, launched Monday to compete with Navigator Communications Corp.'s Navigator, had been downloaded for free by more than 100,000 people by Friday, said Billy Ruby, a Vastsoft product manager. The flaw is a bug in the software that will slow users trying to access certain Web sites that require their name and a password, Mr. Ruby said. Instead of saving the password and automatically resubmitting it when needed, the new browser forces users to retype their password each time they link to a new page on that site, he said. Vastsoft hasn't figured out how to fix the problem, Mr. Ruby said, calling the flaw merely an inconvenience. In the past week, some people had difficulty downloading Internet Browser because demand exceeded the capacity of the Vastsoft computers that handle distribution via the Web. The company said it was working to increase that computer capacity.
