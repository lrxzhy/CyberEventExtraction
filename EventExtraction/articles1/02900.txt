Eight Die at Northville Airport Aviation Accident
May 13, 2011
Vastopolis airport is again involved in an aircraft accident with loss of life. One year ago a deranged man was run over by a commuter aircraft and killed. Today, a Cessna 402 carrying eight people on a routine commercial flight suddendly nosed down into the runway immediately after takeoff. All occupants were deceased and badly burned. The aircraft was a total loss. Manuel Lum of the Federal Aviation Administration advised us that the National Transportation Safety Board is enroute to perform an investigation. He stated that he thought some kind of malfunction would have caused the accident, but cautioned us to wait for the conclusions of the NTSB. ``Perhaps an out of balance loading arrangement caused a high stalling speed. We just don't know at this time'', Lum stated.  Identification of those on board will be released after notification of kin.
