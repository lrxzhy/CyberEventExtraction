Strike Begins at Nassco As Contract Talks Stall
March 31, 2011
SAN DIEGO -- About 2,700 workers of National Steel & Shipbuilding Co. went on strike Wednesday over whether new workers would be required to become union members. Nassco, the West's largest ship-building company, went private in a management-led employee buyout from former parent Morrison-Knudsen in 1989. Thursday afternoon, about 50 workers marched outside the main gate with picket signs. Only about 1,000 of the company's 3,700 employees showed up for their regular shifts, company officials said. As nonstriking workers emerged from the shipyard during an afternoon shift change, strikers booed and shouted at them in English and Spanish. Union members, who have not had a contract in four years, voted to strike Wednesday afternoon after talks deadlocked on whether workers would be required to join one of seven unions. Leaders of the seven striking unions representing iron workers, machinists, electricians, carpenters, operating engineers, Robey and painters promised to stay out as long as it takes for a contract.
