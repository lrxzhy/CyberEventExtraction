Wall Street's Losses Continue To Depress European Markets
May 12, 2011
The U.S. financial markets will be closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday, and global investors sought to reduce their holding ahead of the long weekend. Two days of losses on Wall Street made European investors jittery. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 64.73 on Thursday and was down roughly 50 points as the trading day ended in Europe on Friday. Stock prices closed flat to lower in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Spain, the Netherlands and South Africa. In dollar terms, the European sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index was down 0.79 to 145.43 at 12:30 p.m. EDT Friday, after slipping 0.89 a day earlier. The world index as a whole lost 1.16 to 137.11, adding to Thursday's loss of 1.15. Plantation and air-freight stocks led the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, while overseas-trading and consumer-electronics issues were among the laggards.
