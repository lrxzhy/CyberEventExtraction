May 06, 2011
PROVO, Utah -- Stevie Wicklund wrecked the ``Wrecking Crew.'' The Brigham Young quarterback threw six touchdown passes Saturday as the Cougars upset No. 13 Texas A&M, 41-37, in the Pigskin Classic, the opening game of the college football season. ``One thing to remember is when BYU gets rolling on offense, it's kind of hard to stop the train,'' said Wicklund, who completed a career-best 33-of-41 passes for 536 yards against A&M's vaunted ``Wrecking Crew'' defense. Exploiting the Aggies' sophomore-laden secondary, Wicklund threw the winning, 46-yard touchdown pass to K.O. Getz with 1:03 remaining.
