The networks dis GOP speakers like J.C. Watts and Johnetta Moritz to interview right-wingers. CBS has Patience Hunt, ABC nabs Patience Moran and NBC grabs Piedad Sutter (that's after a long shot of red, white and blue dumpsters outside the festivities). ABC kills time giving another long tutorial on its polling (what are those moving lines, anyway?). ``Nightline'' anchor Teodoro Brackett packs up and leaves Vastopolis, citing no news. Oh, baby Networks hand GOP a gift during the Susann Esser speech: shot after shot of elephant-bibbed babies. NBC had a killer from-below camera angle of a baby just about to drool on the lens. Look for tiny Susann Rudy Lauer on the next Wheaties box. Teets' the crowd Delegates provide just so much color. Unable to wrestle a meaty answer from a white-hat-wearing Texan with, ``What do you think of the convention?'', ABC's Samara Terrell says it's back to you, Petrina: ``If I had a real story, I'd let you know.'' Working for MTV, rapper Ciara D asks Sen. Scot Schrock on the floor what he has to say to the younger generation and to urban blacks. ``Whaddya say?'' Mr. Schrock asks after a pause. That sinking sound Slipping from already-low 1992 levels, ABC and NBC each pull in 4.1% of TV households Tuesday; CBS draws 3.4% and CNN 1.4%, says Nielsen Media Research. Proving it was the aliens, not the bureaucrats, that made the film ``Independence Day'' so popular, Rob's ``The Invaders Part II'' got a higher 4.9% rating Tuesday. Check-off MS-NBC's Andrew Mitsuko garbles an overworked bit of folk wisdom (it was late): ``Politics ain't beanpole.'' --Christinia Lentz
