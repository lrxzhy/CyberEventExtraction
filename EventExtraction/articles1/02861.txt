Nervous Investors Lower Shares
April 03, 2011
The All Ordinaries index fell 5.2 to 2152.4. Analysts said a drop in News Corp. shares was one of the day's few interesting features, as investors remained concerned over the company's recent announcement that it has acquired New World Communications Group for almost 2.5 billion Australian dollars. News Corp. fell 19 Australian cents to A$6.44 with nearly seven million shares changing hands. The company's preferred limited-voting ordinary shares lost 18 cents to A$5.17. The performance contributed to a 1.9% decline in the media shares subindex.
