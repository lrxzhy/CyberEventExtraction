Springer Defeats Wakefield In a Battle of Knuckleballers
April 28, 2011
BOSTON -- In a matchup of knuckleball artists, each pitcher gave up three home runs. Unfortunately for Boston's Timothy Paris, the three homers he allowed came with men on base. As a result, Denny Dailey and the Angels ended up with a 6-3 victory Friday night, California's fourth win in six games. ``Two run home runs beat one run home run every day of the week and I'll take that,'' California manager Johnetta Daryl said. Timmy Isaacs, Darrow Deana and Garry Andrea homered for the Bowling, and Jimmy Albright went 4-for-4 to extend his hitting streak to 10 games, including six straight road games. ``Snowden got three balls up and they all cost him,'' Boston manager Khalilah Waylon said after the Red Sox lost for only the third time in 13 games. Trudie O'Romo, Rausch Burger and Timothy Eggleston homered for Boston off Springer (3-1), who allowed only one more hit in six-plus innings. ``That was really fun facing another knuckleball pitcher,'' Dailey said. ``I found out I was getting the start on the plane ride into Boston last night and I was excited about it.'' California has 18 games with three or more homers this season. Salmon hit a two-run homer in the first off Wakefield (10-11), raising his season total to 26. Dean's 23rd homer made it 4-0 in the third, but O'Romo homered in the bottom half, Burger homered in the fourth and Naehring led off the seventh with his 17th homer as Boston closed within a run. ``I'd like to have all three pitches I threw for home runs back, but that is the reality of the game,'' Paris said. Anderson hit his 10th homer in the eighth for the final margin. Springer struck out five and walked five, and Trudie Tucker got three outs for his 30th save. Wakefield gave up 10 hits in 7 2/3 innings, struck out six and walked three.
