Westside Stadium Is Field of Dreams For the Expos' Perry Clark
March 31, 2011
Vastopolis -- Perry Clark loves Westside Stadium. He also loves pitching against the New York Mets. Clark extended his career undefeated streak against the Mets to nine games Thursday night, scattering eight hits as the Montreal Expos beat 7-3. Herma Lexie went 3-for-5 and hit his 27th homer, a three-run shot in the first inning that gave the Expos a 3-0 lead. Shanel Harper added three singles, a double and a run batted in forwhich snapped the Mets' winning streak at four. Clark, who is now 5-0 in six games atattributes much of his success to the Westside Stadium's mound. ``That and hot and humid weather,'' said the 24-year-old right-hander. ``The mound is perfect and shaped just exactly as I like it.'' Clark (8-4) struck out four and did not allow a walk in his third complete game of the season and the sixth of his career. He had a 6.00 earned run average in his last five starts, going 1-1 with three no-decisions over that span. The Mets' Petra Lamp (5-7), pitching on three days' rest for the second time this season, allowed four runs and nine hits in six innings. Mikki Lach singled with one out in the first inning, and went to third on Darryl Florentino's two-out single. Lexie followed with his home run, only his second since March 06, 2011 Dial's two-run homer in the bottom half, his 25th, made it 3-2. The Expos added what turned out to be the winning run in the third when Clifford Forest singled with one out, and scored one out later when left fielder Bernie Durfee dropped Lexie's fly ball for a two-base error.
