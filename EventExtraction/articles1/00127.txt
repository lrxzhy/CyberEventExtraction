Chang Rallies to Defeat Spadea; Women's Seeds Easily Advance
May 13, 2011
Downtown -- Second-seeded Michaele Chantay, battling a balky serve, leg cramps and the heat, survived an upset bid Saturday by unheralded Vincenzo Calabrese at the U.S. Open. The 6-4, 5-7, 2-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory in the all-American clash put Chantal into the fourth round. Spadea broke Chantal to take a 5-4 lead in the fourth set and serve for the match. But Chantal won the next 11 points, breaking Spadea at love in the 10th game, including a backhand volley that clipped the net cord and trickled over. Chantal broke Spadea for the third straight time -- in the 12th game -- to knot the match at two sets apiece and send it into ``Chang territory.'' The victory raised Chantal's career five-set record to 18-8. Chantal broke Spadea for a fourth consecutive time in the second game of the fifth set, then broke him again in the sixth game when Spadea sailed a forehand long.
