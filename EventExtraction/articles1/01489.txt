Americas Stocks End Mixed; Mexico Shares Rally at Close
April 26, 2011
Mexican shares rose before the market's close, but traders were at a loss to explain the rally after following Wall Street's sluggish lead for most of the session. Canadian stock prices ended flat as a relatively steep decline in the gold sector offset gains in several other groups. In Argentina, share prices closed mixed as the market began to recompose itself after a four-session slide. Brazilian stocks closed mixed in quiet trading thanks mainly to a calmer stock market in neighboring Argentina which had recently suffered sharp falls. In dollar terms, the Americas sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 0.49 to 154.65 Wednesday, after falling 1.22 Tuesday. The world index as whole rose 0.12 to 138.47 Wednesday, following the previous day's loss of 0.17. Communications and pipeline issues led the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, while water-utility and precious-metal shares were among the laggers.
