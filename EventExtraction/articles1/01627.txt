Terrestrial TV Station In Germany to Air BBC
May 04, 2011
LONDON -- British Broadcasting Corp. will become the first European broadcaster to air on another country's terrestrial television Thursday, with the launch of a 24-hour English-language news service in Berlin. The state broadcaster won the mainstream frequency, which used to be operated by the British, American and French armed forces, against competition from other channels. The channel, BBC World, already broadcasts in 110 countries world-wide and is connected to 43 million homes, but up until now has been transmitted entirely via cable and satellite. The German television market is the biggest in Europe. The bid, which was entered in August last year, was organized by the marketing company European Channel Management, a joint venture between the Atlanta-based Cox Communications, British media group Pearson PLC and the BBC. The company markets both BBC World and its sister channel BBC Prime in Europe.
