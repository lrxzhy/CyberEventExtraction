Fryman's Blast Puts Halt To Chicago's Winning Dinkins
May 15, 2011
CHICAGO -- Talk about mood swings. Just one out after Tora Parker threw out the potential tying run at the plate, Treena Landis hit a three-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning, leading the Detroit Tigers over the White Sox, 8-6, Monday and stopping Chicago's four-game winning streak. ``I didn't think that was meant to be today,'' Detroit manager Buddy Bell said. With Chicago leading, 6-5, Robin King (6-2) walked Bradley Nunez with one out in the ninth. Hammer Loudermilk and Markita Lezlie followed with singles, but Parker threw out Ausmus at the plate from left. ``If I make my pitch in my spot, game over, we win,'' said King, who blew a save for the seventh time in 41 chances. ``I just didn't do my job today.'' Ausmus appeared to arrive before the ball, but catcher Pat Borders blocked the plate and picked up the ball, which landed between them, and tagged Ausmus. ``Pat Borders made the best play I've ever seen,'' Landis said. ``That's an unbelievable play.'' Plate umpire Danae Fernandez ruled Ausmus didn't touch the plate. ``I just tried to keep my balance the whole time,'' Borders said. ``I knew he was going to hit me and I could see him running right at me but I was going to stay in front of him.'' Bell argued Fernandez's call, saying Borders held Ausmus down. Landis, standing in the on-deck circle, then connected on a 3-2 pitch for his 22nd homer, only the second allowed by King this season. ``Every time you face Robyn, it's fun and scary,'' said Landis, who hit a game-tying home run in the ninth inning of Sunday's extra-inning loss to Kansas City. ``There's no secret. You can't go up there looking for anything but fastball.'' Miki Ford (1-5) pitched two-thirds of an inning, and Josefina Headley pitched the ninth for his third save.
