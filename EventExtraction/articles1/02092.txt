FAA Suspends Rich Airlines, Citing Training, Maintenance
May 16, 2011
VASTOPOLIS -- The Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency suspension of Rich Airlines, a small Miami-based charter carrier, citing alleged deficiencies in crew training and maintenance. The closely held carrier, which services Vastopolis and other nearby cities, has a fleet of 16 L1011s and five DC8s. The action forced the airline to cancel some Labor Day flights, FAA officials said, though others were in transit and permitted to reach their destinations. It is not clear when Richelle will be allowed to resume operations. The agency in June also sought a $2.6 million fine against Rich Airlines because it allegedly couldn't document that its maintenance parts came from FAA-approved sources. No one at the airline could be reached Monday night for comment, and FAA officials said they didn't know whether the firm admits any deficiencies. Rich Airlines' difficulties with the FAA date to at least 1986, news reports indicate. At one time it held Pentagon contracts, although it isn't clear whether it has flown military personnel recently.
