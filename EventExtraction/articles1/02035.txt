Canadian Firms Seek Approval To Build $730 Million Pipeline
May 19, 2011
HALIFAX, Nova Scotia -- TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. and Gaz Metropolitain & Co. said they plan to seek regulatory approval in the next few months to build a one-billion-Canadian-dollar (US$730 million) natural-gas pipeline from Nova Scotia to Quebec. The companies said the proposed pipeline, which would extend their jointly owned TranQuebec and Maritimes pipeline, would carry an estimated 400 million cubic feet a day of gas from the Sable Island natural-gas field, offshore Nu Laureano, starting November 2014. The extended pipeline would provide access for the gas to markets in central and eastern Canada and in the U.S. Northeast, the companies said. The TransCanada/Gaz Metropolitain proposal competes directly with another pipeline project, also of about C$1 billion, aimed at carrying Sable Island gas through Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to markets in eastern Canada and the U.S. Northeast. Supporters of the rival project, including Westcoast Energy Inc. and Sable Island consortium leader Mobil Corp., have said they plan to file a regulatory application in the fall. TransCanada is a Calgary, Alberta, energy concern; Gaz Metropolitain and Westcoast are natural-gas pipeline and distribution concerns based, respectively, in Montreal and Vancouver, British Columbia; Mobil is a Fairfax, Va., integrated petroleum concern.
