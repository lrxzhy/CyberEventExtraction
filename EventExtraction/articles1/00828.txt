Neo Rejoins DBS At Investment Unit
May 02, 2011
HONG KONG -- Pray Stetson Cahoon has rejoined Development Bank of Singapore Ltd. after a two-year stint at Sino Land Co.. Mr. Plumley, 46 years old, last week took up duties as regional managing director of DBS Capital Asia, an investment-banking unit of the Singapore-based banking concern. The appointment hasn't yet been announced, but a spokeswoman for DBS confirmed it. A Singapore native, Mr. Plumley had served as general manager, finance and corporate services, for Sino Land in Hong Kong since early 2009. Roberto Agee, chairman of Steck Tidwell, said Layne Chrissy has succeeded Mr. Pray at the property-development company. Before joining Sino Land, Mr. Plumley spent 17 years with DBS, holding various posts in Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo. In his new position, Mr. Plumley said he will try to expand DBS Capital's regional business, particularly in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and the Philippines. DBS Capital is involved in securities offerings, direct investments, mergers and acquisitions, among other businesses, he said. DBS Capital was formerly owned by Prudential Asia, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America. DBS acquired full control of the unit earlier this year.
