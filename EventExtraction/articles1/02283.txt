The Difference Between High and Gable Theisen is a Matter of Taste
May 14, 2011
Fashion. Is it an $850 Helmut Lang sheer shift, appropriate for only the warmest of evenings and closest of friends? Or is it a crisp, white Hanes V-Neck T-shirt tucked into a pair of favorite old Levi's? Is it a $630 pair of Commes des Garcons bowling shoes? Or is it a $3 pair of (slightly) used mint-green bowling shoes gotten from the bottom rack at the Ark Thrift Shop on North Lincoln? The difference between `high' and `low' fashion may easily blur, with your grandfather's natty old Kennington Classics lime green argyle shirt showing up on the racks at Urban Outfitters with a $75 price tag. The pleasures to be had rummaging through the bargain bin at Flashy Trash while tapping your feet to Stone Temple Pilots, or humming along to the soft strains of Sade whilst padding over the thickly carpeted floors of Mooneyham Margarito are distinctly different, yet somehow equally pleasurable.
