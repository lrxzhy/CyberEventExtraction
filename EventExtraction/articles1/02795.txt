Speakers Find Their Niche In the Gardens of the Rich
May 05, 2011
They are the latest keep-up-with-the-Quincy Joneses, can't-live-without toys that music-industry icons and audiophiles alike are buying: hidden, high-fidelity outdoor speakers. They're made by an Aurora, Colo., company called Rockustics Inc. ``These speakers reproduce the full range of tonal qualities in an open space environment,'' says Johnetta Deana, whose company, Daveco, designs home audio and theater systems in New York and Connecticut. ``Rockustics are leaders in the industry, and their products are superior by far.'' The speaker cabinets look like simulated rocks, so they blend in with the natural environment of a garden or backyard. They are made with crushed stone and are able to withstand the elements: heat, rain, snow, wind and sun, including ultraviolet rays. The company sells 24 models, including ones shaped like coconuts or frogs. But they aren't cheap. One pair of ``Rocky Juniors,'' which are 16-inch-high, 100-watt speakers that project sound as far as 150 feet away, cost about $1,000. Then it's another $1,500 for 200 feet of quality speaker cable, a volume control and underground wiring. ``The quality is very good, and I love the idea of music outdoors,'' says Roberto Vogel, a 40-year-old financial planner in upscale Toluca Lake, Calif., who installed Rockustics speakers in his backyard last month. ``They are practically invisible and out of reach from my two young children, so I feel it's safe.'' Moreover, Los Angeles general contractor Ciara Skidmore says, ``The wiring is so low-voltage that you could put your tongue on it and it wouldn't even bother you.'' And Bradley Stamey, another Los Angeles audio-system designer, describes the sound as ``gorgeous and exceptional.'' But, if you are still concerned about these speakers' sound quality, know that recording artist Gloria Estefan has just placed an order. --Felicita Guerin
