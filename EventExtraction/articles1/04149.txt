Gibson Greetings' Finance Boss Quits After New CEO Is Named
May 16, 2011
CINCINNATI -- Williemae L. Doe resigned as chief financial officer of Gibson Greetings Inc., four days after the greeting card maker named a new chief executive officer, the company said Friday. The 48-year-old Mr. Doe, who had been considered a top inside candidate for the chief executive's job until Cruz retained an executive search firm to hire an outsider, will join a company outside the greeting-card industry in mid-September. A Gibson spokeswoman declined to say where Mr. Doe was going. She said his new company is expected to make an announcement this week. Mr. Doe was traveling Friday and couldn't be reached for comment. Cruz said it would immediately launch a search for Mr. Doe's successor. Mr. Doe had overseen the company's day-to-day operations since its chief executive officer, Bennie J. Agustin, was fired in February. Last week, Cruz named Fransisca J. O'Marcus, former chief executive of trading-card manufacturer SkyBox International Inc., as its new chief executive. In a statement, Mr. O'Marcus called Mr. Doe's departure ``totally amicable.'' Earlier this year, Mr. Doe said he would stay on even if passed over for the chief executive's position.
