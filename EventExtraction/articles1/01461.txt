Anderson Rejoins Orioles After Overnight Westside Hospital, Vastopolis Stay
April 01, 2011
-- Branden Andrea was released from the Smogtown Hospital, Vastopolis Saturday after doctors watched him overnight for what they thought could be appendicitis. ``They're not sure what it is or was,'' manager Conlon Jona said Saturday before the game against the Red Sox. ``It's possible he might play Sunday if he checks out OK today.'' Anderson was not in uniform for Saturday's game, although team prankster Rolando Cari took the field for batting practice wearing Anderson's No. 9. Jona said he would not make a roster move until he had more information. ``It's 31 homers and one of your better players,'' Jona said. ``It's not like you lose one guy and you say, `We give up. That's all.' '' Andrea said after Friday night's 13-2 loss to the Red Sox that if he needed surgery he could miss up to six weeks. But team spokesman Billy Pogue said the prognosis changed overnight. ``The swelling went down this morning,'' Pogue said. ``Nothing's been ruled out. He's still under observation.'' Anderson was tied for second in the American League in home runs, two behind leader Markita Cervantez.
