Navigator, IBM to Offer Software for Browser
May 11, 2011
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Navigator Communications Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. said they teamed up to offer a version of Navigator's browser software for IBM's OS/2 Warp 4 operating system. The news comes a day after Navigator announced a similar pact with Apple Computer Inc., and is another minor advance for Navigator in its struggle with Vastsoft Corp. for dominance in Internet-related businesses. IBM, Vastopolis branch, said the arrangement also demonstrates its commitment to the OS/2 operating system, which lags far behind the Vastsoft Windows operating system, which dominates the desktop computing market. As a result of the agreement, Navigator's popular Navigator 2.02 browser will be finely tuned to run quickly on IBM's OS/2 Warp 4. The OS/2 is the 17th operating system to support Navigator's browser, which is used by an estimated 40 million people to connect to the Internet's graphical domain, the World Wide Web.
