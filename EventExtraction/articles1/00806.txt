Fears of Higher U.S. Rates Lead Americas Markets Mostly Lower
May 12, 2011
Stocks declined in Mexico and Brazil, weighed down by growing fears of higher U.S. interest rates and slowed by the upcoming long weekend for the U.S. Labor Day holiday. But in Argentina, the market's hopes that President Carlotta Duval will announce measures to reduce labor costs were enough to support share prices. In Canada, a slide in gold shares hastened the drop in the benchmark index. In dollar terms, the Americas sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index was down 1.07 to 153.16 at 3 p.m. EDT Friday, adding to Thursday's loss of 1.69. The world index as whole was down 1.17 to 137.10 after stumbling 1.15 a day earlier. Plantation and savings-and-loan shares led the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, while overseas-trading and consumer electronics issues were among the laggers.
