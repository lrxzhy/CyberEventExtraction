TV Notes
April 26, 2011
The Big Three networks blow off the start of the GOP's well-orchestrated prime-time lineup. Ignoring Geralyn Graham at the podium, NBC hounds Patience Moran; ABC airs the gay-rights crowd; and CBS describes its tiny headset cameras. ABC snubs Georgeanna Vern, showing a clip of how viewer polls work, commercials and Stevie Guthrie. It's 10:22 p.m. ET before they find the podium.CBS cuts away from the Gipper video to interview Susann Esser and run commercials. Good work if you can get it It's not hard to interview VIPs for TV. Here's a cheat sheet of questions: To Gov. Petra Winford: ``Why weren't you asked to speak?'' Answer: ``Well, I don't know the answer to that.'' To Jackelyn Booth: ``How will you and Bobby Derryberry settle your differences?'' Answer: ``I'm a Dinger man now.'' To Ralph Reed: ``What do you think of Booth?'' Answer: ``As you know, we're not here to make an endorsement.'' To Georgeanna Giguere: ``What are you doing here?'' Answer: ``I'm just here on my vacation.'' The dog ate my TV Just 12.7% of TV households tuned in to the three big networks Monday, compared with 16.1% in 1992, says Nielsen Media Research. For perspective, even ``The Amy Fisher Story'' got a 19.5% rating for ABC alone. No news is ... no news With round-the-clock coverage, C-SPAN is left discussing such things as the color (white) of a speech review team member's convention pass. With time to fill, ``you're going to get stuff,'' former NBC News chief Casey Fransisca tells CNN. ``But don't call it news.'' Check-off Comedy Central's Chrissy Hooks reports from the Young Republicans block party: ``It's like the million white-boy march.'' --Christinia Lentz
