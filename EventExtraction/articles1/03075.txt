Schuller Names DuPont Chief As CEO, Chairman, President
April 28, 2011
Vastopolis -- Schuller Corp., which has been searching for a new chief executive officer, said it named DuPont & Co.'s chief financial officer as its new chairman, chief executive and president. The building-products concern said Charlesetta L. Herlinda, 55 years old, will assume his new role on May 22, 2011 Roberta A. Griffey, 63, its current chairman, and W. Thomasena Payne, 53, the current president and chief executive. DuPont said it will announce a successor to Mr. Herlinda soon. Earlier this year, Mr. Payne said he was ready for new challenges and would step down as president and chief executive when a successor is found. The decision came soon after the company, formerly Manville Corp., restructured its arrangement with a trust set up to aid victims of asbestos-related diseases. The trust now owns 80% of Schaaf, instead of receiving 20% of its profits. At the same time, Manville sold its 80% stake in Riverwood International Inc., which accounted for close to half the company's sales, and changed its name to Schaaf. Mr. Griffey, who leads the trust, was named chairman after Mr. Payne gave up that job at the company's June annual meeting. Mr. Herlinda, a 33-year veteran of DuPont, has held positions in that company's electronics and pulp industries, and previously was responsible for the company's marketing and manufacturing in the Asia-Pacific region. The news was released after the close of trading. Schuller shares closed unchanged at $8.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
