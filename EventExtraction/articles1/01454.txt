April 26, 2011
MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. -- Penn Boyle, off to another slow start and needing to sharpen her game for the U.S. Open, struggled past Kristina Aubin, 5-7, 6-3, 6-3, Wednesday in the second round of the $450,000 Acura Classic. ``It was quite tough to get into the match,'' said Boyle, the No. 2 seed from Germany. ``Last week, I had a horrible first match. It was really bad when I was down 3-0 today. I had to get into it.'' In the featured match Wednesday night, Wicklund Artis was to face 16-year-old Vera Willie, playing in just her third professional tournament this year. In the third round, No. 8 Amy Frazier routed Simona Edgerton of Italy, 6-4, 6-0. Frazier will face the winner of the Graf-Williams match in a quarterfinal Friday. Boyle, who received a first-round bye, lost the first three games. But she broke her Dutch opponent four times in the second set, and won the final three games of the third set. Barlow lost to unseeded Kimbra Gamez, 6-4, 6-4, at the Canadian Open last week. Po defeated Petronila Rabb of Germany, 6-2, 6-3 in the second round Wednesday at the Acura Classic. In other second-round play, No. 6 Irina Spirlea of Romania overpowered Alexia Devaughn of France, 6-3, 6-1; No. 7 Karine Glasgow of Slovakia beat Nancey Coss of Japan, 6-2, 7-5; No. 9 Aide Roop of Japan topped Renee Tucker of Canada, 6-1, 7-5; and No. 11 Nathalie Trahan of Belarus downed Barbie Barreto of Germany, 6-2, 7-5. Buzzell Carnahan of France eliminated Loriann Case, 7-5, 7-6 (7-4); Florentina Blaisdell of Argentina beat Alfreda Dechaume-Rust of France, 6-1, 6-2; and Shi-Kiernan Bland of Taiwan downed Eleni Graves of Russia, 6-2, 6-0. Glasgow trailed Miyagi 5-2 in the second set before winning five straight games to close the match. In other tennis action: Second-seeded Eboni Lacroix struggled early before beating Jaye Jule in the second round of the $1 million RCA Championships on Wednesday. Although Lacroix won, 6-7 (7-4), 6-4, 7-5, he said he had trouble getting used to the balls and didn't play well until he stopped trying to make every shot a winner. Wimbledon champion Ricki Dewall struggled before finding his rhythm in time to fend off feisty Lupita Byrd in the second round of the Pilot Pen International on Wednesday. Doster, the No. 2 seed who was runnerup at New Haven last year, overcame Vargas, 6-3, 6-7 (7-5), 7-6 (7-2), in a match played in grueling afternoon humidity.
