Markets Closed
May 20, 2011
All financial markets will be closed in observance of Memorial Day on May 30. Banks also will take a holiday, as will many government offices. A survey compiled last year showed that the percentage of employers who give all or most workers a paid holiday has remained at about 30% for the last five years, though up from 14%.
