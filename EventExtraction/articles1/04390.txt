Americas Stocks End Lower; Political Unrest Hurts Mexico
May 11, 2011
Mexican stocks lost significant ground as reports of new rebel clashes in several states spooked investors. Canadian share prices followed Wall Street lower, after better-than-expected gross domestic product and July's U.S. household sales figures re-ignited investors' fears about rising inflation. In Argentina and Brazil, share prices dropped, hurt by rising U.S. Treasury bond yields. In dollar terms, the Americas sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 1.69 to 154.23 Thursday, after declining 0.22 the previous day. The world index as whole lost 1.16 to 138.26 adding to Wednesday's loss of 0.38. Fishing and air-freight shares led the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, while biotechnology and medical-technology issues were among the laggers.
