Stocks Suffer as U.S. Stumbles
March 28, 2011
The AEX index of 25 leading stocks closed at 528.27, down 10.97 points, or 2.03%, from Monday's close at 539.24. Traders called it a hectic day, with nervous domestic investors following the U.S. lead. Brokers also said the stronger opening of Wall Street this morning helped some stocks to recover as domestic investors returned to Dutch quality shares. Meanwhile, the dollar weakened against the guilder, trading at 1.6747 guilders compared to 1.7054 guilders late on Monday. The Dutch stock market is highly dollar sensitive as a number of index companies derive much of their overseas revenues in dollars. On the Dutch bond market, prices were generally higher. The 8.5% 10-year government bond is at 114.35, up from late Monday's 114.20. Its yield stands at 6.48%.
