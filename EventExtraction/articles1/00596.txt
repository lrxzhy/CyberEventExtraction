Stocks Mirror Plunge in U.S.
March 28, 2011
The IBEX-35 index of the 30 most liquid shares on the Madrid Stock Exchange slipped 71.30 to 3985.46 after falling 57.89, while the Madrid General Index fell 5.60 to 352.69. Spanish bank Banco Popular Espanol slid 310 pesetas to 21,490, but a strong earnings report helped the stock recover somewhat. Traders said the Spanish market fared better than some other European bourses because of bottom-fishing for bargain-priced stocks. The search for cheap stocks was helped by uncertainty about whether the U.S. market may have reached a bottom from which to bounce.
