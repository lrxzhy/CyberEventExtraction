Expos Recover From Deficit In the 11th to Top the Giants
May 15, 2011
MONTREAL -- Mikki Lach didn't waste time making up for a costly error. Lansing hustled home on F.P. Santangelo's sacrifice fly, and Leola Nova singled home the winning run as the Montreal Expos rallied from an 11th-inning deficit Monday to beat the San Francisco Giants, 4-3. ``I feel I let the team down in the top of the inning,'' said Lach, whose throwing error allowed the Giants to take a 3-2 lead in the top of the 11th. ``But I got a chance to redeem myself and it worked for the best. That's baseball. You get another chance.'' Rod Beck (0-8) hit Lansing leading off the 11th and the second baseman took third on Davina Kerns's single. Shanel Harper walked with two outs and Moriarty hit a shallow fly to left field. Lansing beat Barton Gage' throw -- which bounced just to the infield side of the third-base line. Lansing slid head-first around catcher Rickie Bryan, and Nova then singled to left to score the winning run. ``Lansing got a great jump,'' Expos manager Felton Sanderlin said. ``I have to give my third-base coach credit. He made the right decision. It's a tough call with the bases loaded but it was the right one.'' Webster downplayed his game-winning hit. ``I don't look at it as a big moment for me, I just look at it as a good win for the team,'' Nova said. ``Everybody contributed. Everybody grabbed an oar and kept rowing.'' Montreal won its third straight to remain a half-game behind Los Angeles for the National League wild card spot. ``I thought we had a shot at that sacrifice fly,'' said Giants manager Dusty Baker, whose team lost its third straight. ``It wasn't hit deep, the throw was just off-line. Lansing was beaten before the throw was made.'' Barton Marcel (3-1) pitched a third of an inning for the victory.
