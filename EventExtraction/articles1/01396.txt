Stock Prices Settle Mixed In Major European Markets
May 09, 2011
Gains in Spanish bonds lifted stock prices in Madrid, while Swiss stocks were supported by gains in the financial sector and Sweden's market was led higher by forestry stocks. In Frankfurt, prices rose in electronic trading after posting moderate gains earlier in the day in official floor trading. Program trading, meanwhile, boosted prices in the Netherlands. Prices eased in London, though, as several companies prepared to pay out dividends, and stocks declined in Paris, hurt by the weak French franc. Elsewhere, investors in South Africa reacted with relief to what they hoped was the end of the market's prolonged slide. In dollar terms, the European sector of the Dow Jones World Stock Index rose 0.11 to 146.86 Tuesday, after slipping 0.23 a day earlier. The world index as a whole gained 0.27 to 139.79, adding to Monday's loss of 0.73. Advertising and tobacco stocks led the Dow Jones Global Industry Groups, while plantations and mining issues were among the laggards. European Stock Market Indexes Market Belgium
