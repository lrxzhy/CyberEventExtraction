Index Follows Regional Losses
May 12, 2011
The Stock Exchange of Thailand Index slid 3.27 to 1102.32 on volume of 43.8 million shares valued at 3.20 billion baht. The select SET 50 index fell 0.40 to 84.02. Decliners outnumbered advancers 155 to 126. Analysts said the market fell in line with other Asian-Pacific bourses, which declined because of Wall Street's dismal performance overnight. Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo all closed lower after the Dow Jones Industrials Average plunged 64.73 to 5647.65 Thursday. Otherwise, trading was generally devoid of any market-moving factors. Investors avoided the bourse, waiting to see what measures Thailand will take to boost exports. From the Bank of Thailand's monthly release of economic data Thursday, analysts calculated export growth at a 3.8% average over the first seven months of the year. The uncertainty was reflected in the banking sector. Thai Farmers Bank slipped 1 baht to 173, and Bangkok Bank was steady at 218.
