Stocks Follow U.S. Bonds
May 19, 2011
The blue-chip FT-SE 100 share index advanced 5.8 points to 3893.0, the day's high, on provisional volume of 621.1 million shares. Traders said markets fell following the release of the U.S. employment data, which was stronger than expected. But on closer inspection, market players realized that the data was skewed by a strong showing in the public sector. Data for the private sector were close to expectations. Blue chips rallied throughout the late afternoon to close at session highs after spending most of the session in negative territory. The recovery among blue chips didn't extend to mid-sized issues. The FT-SE 250 index lost 3.5 points to 4403.2.
