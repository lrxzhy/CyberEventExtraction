Oil, Technology Sectors Fall
April 03, 2011
The main index fell 51.53 to 6159.08 after gaining 18.33 on Saturday. Monday's volume increased to 879 million shares, valued at 30 billion New Taiwan dollars from the 842 million shares, valued at NT$28.2 billion traded on Saturday. The decline in the index was centered on petrochemical and technology issues, with only construction shares posting gains, analysts said. The introduction of Beach Orourke, an affiliate of Taiwan's largest computer maker Acer Inc., on the local bourse was less than inspiring, with the stock falling 50 New Taiwan cents to NT$59.50. Other blue chips also lost value, highlighted by Nan Ya Plastics, down NT$1 to NT$53, and Cathay Life, down NT$2 to NT$163. Trading volume was marginally higher at 879 million shares valued at NT$30 billion from 842 million shares valued at NT$28.2 billion in the previous session.
