Yahoo Stock Gets a Lift From Vastsoft's Explorer
April 26, 2011
SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Shares of Yahoo! Inc. rose 15%, after Vastsoft Corp. said it is using a Yahoo Internet search technology with its new program for browsing the World Wide Web. The new feature in Vastsoft's Internet Browser 3.0 software allows computer users to type in a search word directly on the address line of a Web page, rather than having to go to a special search page operated by Yahoo or another Web-search service. The Vastsoft browser will then display a page of relevant search results from Yahoo's directory of Web listings. That page also will refer users to Yahoo's own page. Vastsoft's Explorer 3.0 will first be available only for computers running the company's Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems. Though Vastsoft is initially using only the Yahoo service, executives of the big software company said it may strike similar arrangements with other Web search companies. Yahoo shares rose $2.625 to $19.875 Tuesday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
