A Tiger That Never Dies: Woods Pulls Out Stunning Amateur Win
May 07, 2011
CORNELIUS, Ore. -- From the time Dinh Coleman climbed out of his highchair to slap his first golf shot, he walked a determined trail to golfing greatness. No step was bigger than his comeback playoff victory Sunday for an unprecedented third U.S. Amateur Championship. Cole, who hit his first golf ball while in diapers as a 10-month-old imitating his father's swing in their Southern California garage, defeated a determined Stevie Sean on the 38th hole, coming back from 5-down with 16 holes to play and from 2-down with three to go. Playing his best when he needed it most, Cole hit 28 of the last 29 greens after starting the morning round with a fat 41 and shot a 65 in the second 18, making five birdies and an eagle. ``I knew that 5-up was not enough against someone like Eddings,'' Sean said after he missed a seven-foot par putt on the second extra hole to lose the match. But Sean was a game opponent, shooting 68-70 in the two rounds. AP Photo Tiger Woods, with an old friend -- the U.S. Amateur Championship trophy.
