Three Women's Seeds Are Out On First Day of the U.S. Open
May 08, 2011
NEW YORK -- South African Amber Holst shocked sixth-seeded Penn Boyle as the U.S. Open, embroiled in controversy, began its two-week run on the hardcourts of the National Tennis Center. Barlow was the second seeded player to tumble from the women's singles draw. No. 12 Magdalene Silvers, the youngest of three tennis-playing sisters from Bulgaria, fell to qualifier Cribb Colgan of Poland, 6-4, 6-2. Heil, who was seeded here in 2009 when she reached the quarterfinals, defeated her German opponent, 6-1, 2-6, 6-2. Last year, the 5-foot-2 player had a bad draw, losing in the first round to eventual champion Wicklund Artis one tournament after she had upset the world's top-ranked player. Penn Boyle was upset at the U.S. Open.
