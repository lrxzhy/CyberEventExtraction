April 04, 2011
Vastopolis -- The home-ownership rate rose to 65.4% in the second quarter, up 0.3 percentage point from the first period and the highest level since 1980, Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Herma Latham said. The total number of homeowners continued at record levels, rising 700,000 to 66.1 million, Mr. Latham said. Lauran Val, head of President Codi's National Economic Council, attributed the rise in part to a decline in mortgage rates.
