FCC to Divide Radio Spectrum Between Cable, Satellite Firms
March 30, 2011
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission adopted a long-pending plan to divide a swath of radio spectrum between cellular-style wireless cable-television and satellite-communications network industries. The action gives a big lift to the new cellular-style wireless technology, known as local multipoint distribution service, or LMDS. CellularVision of New York Inc., with investment backing from Bell Atlantic and Philips Electronics, sells LMDS service in New York, but had been blocked from expanding the service because of the spectrum dispute with satellite-minded firms seeking the same frequencies. The FCC decision resolved a dispute between the two industries that the agency thought it had settled a year ago, when it issued proposed rules for carving up the disputed spectrum, in the range of 28 Ghz. Since then, as the two industries and the FCC sought to fine-tune the plan and devise ways to iron out some remaining difficulties, the July 2010 formula began to fall apart. But most companies seeking parts of the 28 Ghz spectrum recently agreed to return to the original plan, and the FCC's decision Wednesday ratifies that agreement. Among participants in the agreement were CellularVision and Philips, LMDS proponents, and satellite interests including VastComm Network, General Electric, General Motors's Hughes Communications Galaxy unit and Teledesic, a venture created by computer magnate Billy Clayton and cellular pioneer Cristopher Marty. The FCC decision still didn't meet objections of Texas Instruments and Hewlett Packard Co. that the plan doesn't accommodate their LMDS return links. The FCC's ruling would allocate those links in the 31 Ghz area, which will mean delays in separate rulemaking and may require the two companies to redesign their systems, FCC officials said.
