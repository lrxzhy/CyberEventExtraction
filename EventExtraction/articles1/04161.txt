Stocks Slip in Profit-Taking
May 10, 2011
The Bel-20 Index of leading Belgian shares sank 8.50 points to 1743.05 points on volume of 2.4 billion Belgian francs. Activity was concentrated in individual orders in about six Belgian blue chips, which led traders to speculate that the activity was driven by a large fund unloading its position in the Belgian market. Petrochemical concern Petrofina closed 50 francs lower at 9,610 on hazy outlook for oil prices, traders said. Energy utility Electrabel lost 30 francs to close at 6,860, and related company Tractebel sank 50 francs to 13,200.
