Stocks Are Mixed
May 15, 2011
The weighted 30-share IBIS DAX stock index, which tracks prices in electronic trading, added 3.85 points to 2538.34. During the session, the index moved between 2530.49 and 2541.49 points. Traders attributed the slight rise in the IBIS DAX to short coverings and support from the stronger dollar and improved bond markets. At 11:19 a.m. EDT, just after the IBIS DAX settled, the dollar traded at 1.4866 against the Deutsche mark. That was up from 1.4795 marks late Friday. The bond market also supported share prices in Monday's electronic trading, dealers said. At 11:21 a.m. EDT, the German benchmark 10-year 6.25% bond dated April 2021 was priced at 99.02 to yield 6.38%, up from Friday's price of 98.95, yielding 6.39%. The weighted 30-share DAX stock index, which tracks price trends in the official session, fell 0.23 points to 2532.88. The DAX and the IBIS DAX are composed of the same stocks and weightings though they track trends in two separate marketplaces.
